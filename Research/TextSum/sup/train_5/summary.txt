our experiments have identified previously unappreciated roles for oct4 for firstly, regulating chromatin structure in a state consistent with self-renewal and pluripotency, and secondly, facilitating the expression of genes that keeps the cell poised to respond to cues that lead to differentiation.analysis of oct4-dependent transcriptional networks regulating self-renewal and pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells.[pubmed]chew jl, loh yh, zhang w, chen x, tam wl, yeap ls, li p, ang ys, lim b, robson p, et al. reciprocal transcriptional regulation of pou5f1 and sox2 via the oct4/sox2 complex in embryonic stem cells.loh y-h, wu q, chew j-l, vega vb, zhang w, et al. the oct4 and nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.oct4 targets regulatory nodes to modulate stem cell function.nanog and oct4 associate with unique transcriptional repression complexes in embryonic stem cells.induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.the oct4 and nanog transcription network regulates pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells.directed and systematic differentiation of cardiovascular cells from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells.see additional file 6 for the symbols legend.click here for file(10m, tiff)additional file 5:networks generated by ipa for focus genes that are down-regulated in miinsn oocytes when compared to miisn oocytes.click here for file(29k, doc)additional file 6:legend of symbols used in the figures shown in additional files 4, 7, 10 and 13.click here for file(1.6m, tiff)additional file 7:top three gene expression networks generated by ipa with the list of genes down-regulated in miinsn oocytes.
