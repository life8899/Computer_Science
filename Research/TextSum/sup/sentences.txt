Analysis of NER protein expression in TGCT-derived cell lines revealed that levels of XPA, ERCC1 and XPF DNA repair proteins are reduced with respect to somatic tumors cells, suggesting that impaired NER function might account for TGCT sensitivity to ICL-inducing agents [9].	|	express	|	tumor	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

However, overexpression of ERCC1 and XPF in TGCT cell lines elicits only a small increase in their ICL-repair proficiency and resistance to cisplatin [10].	|	express	|	line	|	cisplatin

As controls, we used three human fibroblast cell lines, one with significantly reduced expression of ERCC1 (165TOR) [29], one lacking XPF (XP2YO) [30] and a XP2YO cell line complemented with XPF (XP-F) [31].	|	express	|	human	|	line	|	control

Similar to a previous report [9], TGCT cell lines had somewhat reduced ERCC1 expression compared to U2OS (Fig. 3A and C); however, XPF protein levels were not obviously reduced in most cell lines (Fig. 3B and D).	|	express	|	protein	|	line

Because XPF and ERCC1 act as heterodimer, reduced expression in ERCC1 might drive the reduction in ICL-repair proficiency, promoting sensitivity of ECs to cisplatin.	|	express	|	cisplatin	|	ec

However, within EC cell lines, we did not observe a correlation between cisplatin resistance and ERCC1 expression levels.	|	express	|	line	|	cisplatin

To understand whether the defect in the assembly of RAD51 foci observed in most EC cell lines was the consequence of reduced expression of the protein, we performed a western blot analysis.	|	express	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

RAD51 was similarly expressed in U2OS as in EC cell lines (Fig. 5A top panel, and Fig. 5B), indicating that a functional deficiency in formation of RAD51 foci rather than differential expression of this protein may cause an the HR defect.	|	express	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

Because PTEN expression was reported to be virtually absent in 86% of ECs [37], we analyzed protein expression in our EC cell lines.	|	express	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

As shown in Fig. 5A (mid panel) and quantified in Fig. 5C, PTEN was expressed in all cell lines except NCCIT, indicating that, as also suggested in another tumor model [38], reduced PTEN expression was not the primary cause of the defective RAD51 function.	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

Therefore, we analyzed BRCA1 protein expression in EC cell lines as compared to HR-proficient U2OS.	|	express	|	protein	|	line

As shown in Fig. 5D–E, BRCA1 expression was reduced, with respect to U2OS, in Tera-1 and NT2D1 cell lines, but not in 27x-1 and 2102Ep, and not significantly in NCCIT.	|	express	|	line	|	ec

Recent evidence indicates that the treatment of U2OS with the PARP inhibitor PHEN down-regulates BRCA1/RAD51 expression causing a defect in HR [45].	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

We asked whether sensitivity of EC cell lines to AZD2281 correlates with PARP1 protein expression and activity.	|	express	|	protein	|	line

In addition, in most cell lines, PARP1 expression correlated with PARP inducible activity (Fig. 7B–C), suggesting that EC cell lines that rely more strongly on PARP activity to repair DNA damage (due to a reduced proficiency of HR) have increased PARP1 protein levels and are most likely to respond to PARP inhibitor monotherapy.	|	express	|	protein	|	line

Figure 7 Figure 7 In EC cell lines PARP maximal activity correlates with PARP1 protein expression.	|	express	|	protein	|	line

Usanova observed that the overexpression of ERCC1 and XPF could partially reverse the cisplatin-sensitivity of TGCT cell lines [10], suggesting that a reduced proficiency in ICL-repair, induced by the low expression of these factors, in EC cells might promote cisplatin sensitivity [9].	|	express	|	line	|	cisplatin

These results suggest that perhaps 27x-1 cells are defective in a step downstream of RAD51 foci formation, and more in general that ECs are functionally defective in HR-repair, as also suggested by the similar expression of RAD51 in all cell lines (Fig. 5A–B).	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Their identification will likely require high throughput studies to globally examine the gene expression signature that distinguishes TGCT cells from other solid tumor cells that display lower sensitivity to cisplatin treatment.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	cisplatin

However, while in the somatic tumor cell line U2OS ?H2AX signal quickly decreased and returned nearly to control level by 72 hs, even in relatively cisplatin resistant EC cell lines (27x-1, 2102Ep, Tera-1), ?H2AX reduction was much less efficient (Fig. 1B and H, and Fig. S1 I–K).	|	tumor	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec	|	control

Reduced Proficiency of ECs to Repair ICL-induced Damage is Mechanistically Distinct from their Apoptotic Elimination  It has been recently proposed that the inability of the NT2D1 cell line to repair cisplatin-induced damage is due to rapid and massive induction of apoptosis that precedes the onset of DNA damage-repair [8].	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

In addition, sensitivity to cisplatin correlated with the level of S phase RAD51 foci; such that the most cisplatin-sensitive cell line, NT2D1, was the most defective in RAD51 foci assembly.	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

As a control, the assay was also performed in a cell line (Tera-1) in which cisplatin-induced RAD51 focus assembly was low.	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	control

Understanding the mechanisms underlying TGCT sensitivity/resistance to cisplatin as well as the identification of novel strategies to target cisplatin-resistant TGCTs have major clinical implications.	|	target	|	cisplatin	|	ec

However, overexpression of ERCC1 and XPF in TGCT cell lines elicits only a small increase in their ICL-repair proficiency and resistance to cisplatin [10].	|	express	|	line	|	cisplatin

Therefore, while NER proteins appear to have a protective role, their deficiency does not fully explain the unique sensitivity of TGCTs to cisplatin and suggests that additional defects in ICL repair might be of critical significance.	|	protein	|	cisplatin	|	ec

Our results indicate that all EC cell lines are sensitive to AZD2281 monotherapy at clinically relevant concentrations and that inhibition of PARP activity significantly enhances cisplatin cytotoxicity especially in cell lines relatively resistant to the drug.	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

As a control for cisplatin-resistant cells, we used the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and the non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line MCF10A.	|	tumor	|	human	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	control

These results indicate that, although they appear more sensitive to cisplatin than somatic tumor (and non-tumor) cells, EC cell lines differ from each other, suggesting that resistant cells may have acquired specific molecular characteristics that render them less responsive to treatment.	|	tumor	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

However, while in the somatic tumor cell line U2OS ?H2AX signal quickly decreased and returned nearly to control level by 72 hs, even in relatively cisplatin resistant EC cell lines (27x-1, 2102Ep, Tera-1), ?H2AX reduction was much less efficient (Fig. 1B and H, and Fig. S1 I–K).	|	tumor	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec	|	control

Furthermore, the most cisplatin-sensitive cell lines NCCIT and NT2D1 were even more defective in ICL repair such that the ?H2AX signal increased over time after treatment (Fig. 1B and I and Fig. S1L), and a significant fraction of sub-G1 population arose (Fig. 1C).	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

Reduced Proficiency of ECs to Repair ICL-induced Damage is Mechanistically Distinct from their Apoptotic Elimination  It has been recently proposed that the inability of the NT2D1 cell line to repair cisplatin-induced damage is due to rapid and massive induction of apoptosis that precedes the onset of DNA damage-repair [8].	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

Because XPF and ERCC1 act as heterodimer, reduced expression in ERCC1 might drive the reduction in ICL-repair proficiency, promoting sensitivity of ECs to cisplatin.	|	express	|	cisplatin	|	ec

However, within EC cell lines, we did not observe a correlation between cisplatin resistance and ERCC1 expression levels.	|	express	|	line	|	cisplatin

Since resolution of ICL damage requires the coordinated action of multiple repair mechanisms [17], this result suggests that the differential cisplatin-sensitivity of EC cells may depend on dysregulation of DNA repair mechanisms other than XPF-ERCC1.	|	regul	|	cisplatin	|	ec

Figure 3 Figure 3 The high sensitivity of EC cell lines to cisplatin correlates with a reduced expression of ERCC1 but not XPF.	|	express	|	line	|	cisplatin

Since HR repair occurs during genome replication, we tested whether the sensitivity of EC cell lines to cisplatin was due to defective HR-repair by quantifying the number of RAD51 foci in S-phase.	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

In addition, sensitivity to cisplatin correlated with the level of S phase RAD51 foci; such that the most cisplatin-sensitive cell line, NT2D1, was the most defective in RAD51 foci assembly.	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

As a control, the assay was also performed in a cell line (Tera-1) in which cisplatin-induced RAD51 focus assembly was low.	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	control

Thus, although BRCA1 down-regulation might contribute to the increased cisplatin-sensitivity of Tera-1 and NT2D1, it does not appear to fully explain the differential response to cisplatin among EC cell lines.	|	regul	|	line	|	cisplatin

Why are EC cells generally more sensitive to DNA damaging agents than somatic tumors and why are some EC cell lines more sensitive to cisplatin than others?	|	tumor	|	gene	|	line	|	cisplatin

We observed that the initial cisplatin-induced DNA damage measured by ?H2AX staining (Fig. 1B [t = 6 hs] and Fig. 4D), is not significantly different in EC cell lines compared to the somatic tumor cell line U2OS; indicating that the superior responsiveness of EC cells to cisplatin is not attributable to upstream events that regulate cisplatin damage to DNA.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	line	|	cisplatin

In addition, as previously reported in other studies [8], neither high constitutive p53 protein levels nor p53 accumulation/activation upon cisplatin treatment correlated with EC cell lines sensitivity, (Fig. S6) suggesting that EC cells possess unknown intrinsic characteristics that make them unique in their response to DNA damage.	|	protein	|	line	|	cisplatin

Recently, Gutekunst and colleagues proposed that the extreme platinum sensitivity of EC cell lines is due to p53 protein level increases, induced either by DNA damage (cisplatin) or by MDM2-inhibitors (Nutlin-3), resulting in a rapid and massive apoptotic response that prevents DNA repair [8].	|	protein	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

Usanova observed that the overexpression of ERCC1 and XPF could partially reverse the cisplatin-sensitivity of TGCT cell lines [10], suggesting that a reduced proficiency in ICL-repair, induced by the low expression of these factors, in EC cells might promote cisplatin sensitivity [9].	|	express	|	line	|	cisplatin

However, since U2OS can be up to 27-fold more resistant than ECs to cisplatin (Fig. 1A), this difference is unlikely to fully account for the platinum-sensitivity of EC cell lines, suggesting that additional mechanisms of ICL-repair might be defective.	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

The EC cell line 27x-1 which is equally sensitive to cisplatin as 2102Ep and Tera-1 (Fig. 1A) was not defective in this assay, but was equally defective as Tera-1 cells in repair of ISce-I induced DSBs (Fig. 4E and Fig. S3B).	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

Their identification will likely require high throughput studies to globally examine the gene expression signature that distinguishes TGCT cells from other solid tumor cells that display lower sensitivity to cisplatin treatment.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	cisplatin

Flow Cytometric (FACS) Quantification of Phospho-H2AX (Ser139)  Approximately 500×103 cells either treated or untreated with cisplatin, and/or AZD2281, were collected, fixed in cold 70% ethanol, washed in Tris-buffered saline pH 7.4 (TBS) and rehydrated for 10 min at room temperature in TBS with 4% BSA and 0.1% Triton X-100 (TST).	|	line	|	cisplatin	|	ec

Understanding the mechanisms underlying TGCT sensitivity/resistance to cisplatin as well as the identification of novel strategies to target cisplatin-resistant TGCTs have major clinical implications.	|	target	|	cisplatin	|	ec

The latter requires several classes of proteins including the nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins XPF-ERCC1, translesion DNA-polymerases, Fanconi anemia gene products [12], [13], [14], and homologous recombination repair (HR) factors [15].	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

Analysis of NER protein expression in TGCT-derived cell lines revealed that levels of XPA, ERCC1 and XPF DNA repair proteins are reduced with respect to somatic tumors cells, suggesting that impaired NER function might account for TGCT sensitivity to ICL-inducing agents [9].	|	express	|	tumor	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

Therefore, while NER proteins appear to have a protective role, their deficiency does not fully explain the unique sensitivity of TGCTs to cisplatin and suggests that additional defects in ICL repair might be of critical significance.	|	protein	|	cisplatin	|	ec

Homologous recombination (HR) is an attractive candidate based on its importance for ICL repair; HR is frequently dysregulated in a variety of tymor types and HR deficiency is involved in the susceptibility of cancer cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.	|	cancer	|	regul	|	ec

To understand whether the defect in the assembly of RAD51 foci observed in most EC cell lines was the consequence of reduced expression of the protein, we performed a western blot analysis.	|	express	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

RAD51 was similarly expressed in U2OS as in EC cell lines (Fig. 5A top panel, and Fig. 5B), indicating that a functional deficiency in formation of RAD51 foci rather than differential expression of this protein may cause an the HR defect.	|	express	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

Because PTEN expression was reported to be virtually absent in 86% of ECs [37], we analyzed protein expression in our EC cell lines.	|	express	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

As shown in Fig. 5A (mid panel) and quantified in Fig. 5C, PTEN was expressed in all cell lines except NCCIT, indicating that, as also suggested in another tumor model [38], reduced PTEN expression was not the primary cause of the defective RAD51 function.	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

As shown in Fig. 5D–E, BRCA1 expression was reduced, with respect to U2OS, in Tera-1 and NT2D1 cell lines, but not in 27x-1 and 2102Ep, and not significantly in NCCIT.	|	express	|	line	|	ec

ECs are Sensitive to Treatment with the Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitor AZD2281  Preclinical studies have demonstrated that cancer cells with defective HR repair caused by either BRCA1 or BRCA2 inactivating mutations, display exquisite sensitivity to PARP inhibitors [41], [42].	|	cancer	|	site	|	ec

Recent evidence indicates that the treatment of U2OS with the PARP inhibitor PHEN down-regulates BRCA1/RAD51 expression causing a defect in HR [45].	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

These results suggest that perhaps 27x-1 cells are defective in a step downstream of RAD51 foci formation, and more in general that ECs are functionally defective in HR-repair, as also suggested by the similar expression of RAD51 in all cell lines (Fig. 5A–B).	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

BaF3 cells were infected with miR-125a, miR-125b or the control vector, which also expresses a GFP marker.	|	express	|	ec	|	125a	|	control

Although leukemia is induced by overexpression of miR-125b in several models (21, 24, 26?–28), myeloproliferation could be the predominant effect of miR-125a overexpression (20, 29, 30).	|	express	|	ec	|	125a

To address oncogene addiction in the context of MPN, we first assessed the effects of constitutive miR-125a overexpression in vivo to gauge the phenotypes of an inducible miR-125a model to be described later.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	125a	|	oncogen

However, their phenotypes were always weaker compared with the miR-125a recipients in parallel experiments, possibly because of lower expression levels.	|	express	|	ec	|	125a

We engineered a lentiviral vector (hereafter referred to as “i125a”), with the expression of miR-125a under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter, and with a constitutively expressed GFP marker to label the transduced cells (Fig. 3A).	|	express	|	line	|	ec	|	125a	|	control

Bone marrow cells from Rosa26-rtTA mice (31) were transduced with the i125a vector and transplanted into lethally irradiated wild-type recipients to permit inducible miR-125a expression specifically in the hematopoietic compartment.	|	express	|	ec	|	125a

We confirmed that the expression level of miR-125a could be modulated by doxycycline in recipient mice (Fig. S6A).	|	express	|	line	|	ec	|	125a

At the highest dose of either cytokine, similar numbers of colonies were formed by miR-125a and control bone marrow cells, indicating that forced expression of miR-125a did not increase the frequency of clonogenic progenitors at permissive growth conditions with abundant supportive signaling (Fig. 5A).	|	express	|	125a	|	control

Complex oncogene dependence in microRNA-125a–induced myeloproliferative neoplasms Shangqin Guoa,b, Haitao Baib,c, Cynthia M.	|	gene	|	125a	|	oncogen

We report here that microRNA-125a (miR-125a)–induced MPN display a complex manner of oncogene dependence.	|	gene	|	125a	|	oncogen

Our data demonstrate that miR-125a–induced MPN is addicted to its sustained overexpression, and highlight the complex nature of oncogenic miRNA dependence in an early neoplastic state.  oncogene addiction PTPN18 spleen fibrosis The expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is frequently deregulated in human cancers (1, 2).	|	express	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul	|	human	|	125a	|	oncogen

Alteration in miRNA gene expression or function can promote cancer initiation and progression in vivo, leading to the recognition that this class of small noncoding RNAs can function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors (3?–5).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

A special type of cancer maintenance is related to oncogene dependence/addiction, in which the maintenance of cancer phenotype is dependent on the sustained presence of one of the initial driving genetic lesions, even though cancer cells may have acquired additional mutations.	|	cancer	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Indeed, oncogene addiction has been demonstrated for a short list of protein-coding genes in vivo [e.g., c-myc, BCR/ABL, Her-2, and p53 (6–7)], many of which are clinically validated therapeutic targets (8, 9).	|	target	|	gene	|	protein	|	oncogen

Interestingly, recent studies on p53 demonstrate that the phenotype of oncogene addiction can be dependent on the stage of cancer progression (11, 12).	|	cancer	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

In mouse lung cancer models driven by the loss of p53 and mutant k-ras, genetic restoration of p53 leads to significant loss of tumor mass in more advanced tumor cells but not in the earlier, less aggressive ones.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene

We report a barcode genetic screen with the use of a unique miRNA expression library, which led to the identification of miR-125 miRNAs in inducing hypersensitivity toward cytokine signaling in both cell line and primary bone marrow cells.	|	express	|	gene	|	line

To address oncogene addiction in the context of MPN, we first assessed the effects of constitutive miR-125a overexpression in vivo to gauge the phenotypes of an inducible miR-125a model to be described later.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	125a	|	oncogen

These findings illustrate the protein phosphatases as a class of common targets by classic hematopoietic oncogenes, such as BCR-ABL (37), and a noncoding small RNA miR-125a.	|	target	|	gene	|	protein	|	125a	|	oncogen

Unlike the previously reported case of oncogene addiction to miR-21, which resulted in lymphoma formation in mice (10), overexpression of miR-125a resulted in a neoplasm with excessive expansion of the myeloid lineage, representing an early neoplastic stage.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	125a	|	oncogen

Contrasting the lack of oncogene addiction when p53 is restored in early-stage lung adenocarcinomas (18, 19), switching off exogenous miR-125a led to rapid resolution of MPN phenotypes and normalization of hematopoietic parameters.	|	gene	|	125a	|	oncogen

Importantly, splenic lesions of this nature was not present in recipient animals that received control vector-transduced cells, or remained on continuous Dox induction (Figs.

Notably, spleen was also the major site of extramedullary hematopoiesis with constitutive miR-125a overexpression (Fig. 2E and Fig. S3B), with the enlarged spleen supporting red cell production to compensate for ineffective bone marrow erythropoiesis.	|	express	|	site	|	ec	|	125a

To this end, we performed myeloid colony formation assays with bone marrow cells from miR-125a recipients or control vector recipients, using different concentrations of IL-3 or GM-CSF.	|	ec	|	125a	|	control

At the highest dose of either cytokine, similar numbers of colonies were formed by miR-125a and control bone marrow cells, indicating that forced expression of miR-125a did not increase the frequency of clonogenic progenitors at permissive growth conditions with abundant supportive signaling (Fig. 5A).	|	express	|	125a	|	control

Although we were not able to assess the endogenous protein level because of the lack of a reliable antibody, we did observe a down-regulation of the endogenous PTPN18 mRNA with miR-125a overexpression (Fig. 5F).	|	express	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec	|	125a

These data demonstrate that miR-125a targets protein phosphatases and suggest its modulation of cellular protein phosphorylation.	|	target	|	protein	|	125a

Alteration in miRNA gene expression or function can promote cancer initiation and progression in vivo, leading to the recognition that this class of small noncoding RNAs can function as both oncogenes and tumor suppressors (3?–5).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

A special type of cancer maintenance is related to oncogene dependence/addiction, in which the maintenance of cancer phenotype is dependent on the sustained presence of one of the initial driving genetic lesions, even though cancer cells may have acquired additional mutations.	|	cancer	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Indeed, oncogene addiction has been demonstrated for a short list of protein-coding genes in vivo [e.g., c-myc, BCR/ABL, Her-2, and p53 (6–7)], many of which are clinically validated therapeutic targets (8, 9).	|	target	|	gene	|	protein	|	oncogen

Analysis of CDS-located miRNA target sites suggests that they can effectively inhibit translation Jean Hausser1, Afzal Pasha Syed, Biter Bilen and Mihaela Zavolan1 + Author Affiliations  Biozentrum, University of Basel and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 4056 Basel, Switzerland   Next Section Abstract  Most of what is presently known about how miRNAs regulate gene expression comes from studies that characterized the regulatory effect of miRNA binding sites located in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

They form miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) with Argonaute proteins which they guide, through hybridization, to target mRNAs whose expression is subsequently down-regulated (Bushati and Cohen 2007; Bartel 2009).	|	express	|	target	|	regul	|	protein

To determine whether the ElMMo-predicted CDS sites are functional we analyzed eight published data sets (listed in Table 1) that compared mRNA expression before and after transfections of individual miRNAs.	|	express	|	site	|	ec

In principle, these transcripts were expressed and bound by Argonaute proteins, so the transfected miRNAs should have had access to all seed-matching sites in these transcripts.	|	express	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

Among these were many miRNAs with important functions: the epithelial cell-specific (Gregory et al. 2008) hsa-miR-141-3p/200a-3p (P < 10-11), the embryonic stem cell-expressed (Suh et al. 2004; Stadler et al. 2010) hsa-miR-302/372/373-3p/520a-3p (P < 10-8), the oncogenic component of the mir-17/92 cluster hsa-miR-19a-3p (P < 10-6) (Ventura et al. 2008; Olive et al. 2009), the oncogenic hsa-miR-130b-3p/hsa-miR-301a-3p miRNAs (P < 10-6) (Shi et al. 2011), and the hsa-miR-137 (P < 10-6), that is involved in neural maturation (Smrt et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2011).	|	express	|	ec	|	oncogen

Interestingly, overexpression of most of these CDS/3' UTR-co-targeting miRNAs has been linked with tumorigenesis (Voorhoeve et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2008; Olive et al. 2009; Mateescu et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2011).	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene

The correlation is considerably smaller for sites obtained based on measurement of protein expression changes for reasons that are presently unknown (Hausser et al. 2009).	|	express	|	site	|	protein

As shown in Supplemental Figure 15, the expression levels of mRNAs with CDS sites change very little upon knockout of miR-223 whereas their translation increases in the absence of the miRNA to a degree comparable to the translation of transcripts with binding sites in 3' UTRs.	|	express	|	site	|	bind

First, we generated a HEK293T stable cell line containing an episomal pRTS-1 vector from which the expression of hsa-miR-124-3p can be induced with doxycyclin.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

As shown in Supplemental Figure 17, wild-type constructs exhibit a reduction in protein expression relative to the mutant constructs that cannot be explained by a corresponding decrease in mRNA levels.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Recent high-throughput studies concluded that the reduction in protein levels upon miRNA expression is largely a consequence of the mRNA degradation induced by miRNAs (Baek et al. 2008; Selbach et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2010), though these initial experiments may have missed an important kinetic aspect (Bazzini et al. 2012).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Another recurrent finding is that changes in target mRNA level upon miRNA transfection or overexpression are small.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

These findings suggest that CDS and 3' UTR sites function through similar mechanisms and have a comparable impact on gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

Furthermore, proteomics measurements require that the proteins are labeled and this imposes constraints on the timing of miRNA transfection (or induction of expression).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Interestingly, in both the zebrafish system and our reporter system, some mRNAs with miRNA binding sites in coding regions appear to be up-regulated upon miRNA expression.	|	express	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

On one side of the spectrum are miRNAs expressed in the embryonic cells and miRNAs of the miR-17-92 cluster, that target predominantly 3' UTRs, but also show the strongest enrichment in CDS–3' UTR co-targeting.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

For the analysis, we only considered 10,222 genes with nonzero expression levels in all experimental conditions (mock, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-1 transfections/mRNA and rpf sequencing/0, 12, and 32 h after transfection).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

By applying the same reasoning to P(ri|r, H0), one can show the denominator of Equation 7 to be Formula(11)  Finally, substituting Equations 10 and 11 into Equation 7 gives a simple expression for the posterior probability P(H1|r, ri) that the number of CLIP reads ri mapping to site i is larger than what would be expected given the abundance of the mRNA alone: Formula which is the reverse cumulative probability of a Beta distribution.	|	express	|	site	|	ec

Further assuming that transcripts that do not carry at least a heptameric seed-complementary site are unlikely to be real targets, we estimated µk and sk from the observed expression changes of transcripts without such seed matches.	|	express	|	target	|	site

Not knowing the distribution of the severity of the effect that miRNAs have on the expression of their targets we assumed as little as possible about the distribution Pk(f | +), namely that a true target must change expression in the right direction, i.e., f < 0 for a miRNA overexpression experiment, and that expression changes are limited to a finite range over which the expression change has a “uniform” distribution.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that miRNAs also bind in the coding region (CDS), but the implication of these interactions remains obscure because they have a smaller impact on mRNA stability compared with miRNA-target interactions that involve 3' UTRs.	|	target	|	bind	|	ec

Our study suggests that miRNAs may combine targeting of CDS and 3' UTR to flexibly tune the time scale and magnitude of their post-transcriptional regulatory effects.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

They form miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) with Argonaute proteins which they guide, through hybridization, to target mRNAs whose expression is subsequently down-regulated (Bushati and Cohen 2007; Bartel 2009).	|	express	|	target	|	regul	|	protein

There is growing evidence that plant miRNAs can induce translational repression via imperfect complementarity interactions with target sites in CDS and 3' UTRs (Brodersen et al. 2008; Lanet et al. 2009).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

For instance, it has recently been found that hsa-miR-181a targets multiple members of the C2H2 zinc finger domain family, through multiple CDS sites that occur precisely in the regions of the transcripts that encode the C2H2 domains (Schnall-Levin et al. 2011).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Schnall-Levin et al. (2010) allowed for the possibility that sites are not perfectly conserved among “all” genomes used in the inference to show that miRNA targeting in CDS is as common as in the 3' UTRs in Drosophila species.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Finally, Fang and Rajewsky (2011) found evidence that mRNAs that are simultaneously targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR are slightly more destabilized than mRNA targeted only in the 3' UTR, while Schnall-Levin et al. (2011) showed that mRNAs with several miRNA binding sites in the CDS can effectively be degraded.	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

The target sites that we used in our analysis were either predicted computationally or inferred on the basis of transcript- or protein-level changes following miRNA transfections.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

Previous Section Next Section Results  Both CDS and 3' UTR sites are under evolutionary selection The application of the ElMMo model to miRNA target prediction in 3' UTRs was described before (Gaidatzis et al. 2007) and recent assessments indicate that ElMMo is among the most accurate miRNA target prediction methods available (Alexiou et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010; Sturm et al. 2010).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

ElMMo is parameter-free and, by building its background model from the appropriate type of regions, it can in principle predict miRNA target sites in transcript or genomic regions that do not correspond to 3' UTRs.	|	target	|	site	|	free

ElMMo further estimates a miRNA-specific probability that a site that is complementary to the miRNA in the reference species (in this case human) is under selection in at least one other species taken into account in the miRNA target prediction.	|	target	|	site	|	human	|	ec

miRNAs that function in embryonic development co-target the 3' UTR and the CDS The proportion of miRNA-complementary sites estimated to be under evolutionary selection in CDS as opposed to 3' UTRs differs between miRNAs (Fig. 2A).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

(B) Scatter plot of the CDS vs. 3' UTR targeting preference of individual miRNAs against the fold enrichment in transcripts that are targeted in both the CDS and 3' UTR relative to what would be expected if the sites were independently distributed.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

We then determined the fold enrichments in the number of such co-targeted genes relative to what would be expected if miRNAs targeted the CDS and the 3' UTR independently (see section “Enrichments in the number of genes co-targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR” in Methods).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

We found significant evidence of CDS and 3' UTR co-targeting for 62 human miRNAs (P < 0.05 at Fisher's exact test after Bonferroni correction; see Supplemental Table 2).	|	target	|	human	|	ec

The tendency for these miRNAs to target both the CDS and the 3' UTR of individual mRNAs cannot be explained by a general tendency of motif co-occurrence in the CDS and 3' UTR of the same transcripts because co-targeting enrichments beyond threefold are very rarely observed for random motifs (Supplemental Fig. 11).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

The x-axis shows the preference of the miRNA for CDS vs. 3' UTR targeting defined as the signed distance to the line representing the scaling between the number of CDS and 3' UTR sites (Fig. 2A) for the respective miRNA.	|	target	|	site	|	line	|	ec

Interestingly, overexpression of most of these CDS/3' UTR-co-targeting miRNAs has been linked with tumorigenesis (Voorhoeve et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2008; Olive et al. 2009; Mateescu et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2011).	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene

We further found that highly conserved miRNA target sites share these properties, suggesting that miRNA target sites in 3' UTRs have been selected in evolution based on their ability to induce mRNA degradation.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Functional target sites were defined as those that had a high posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or those whose associated transcripts or proteins responded in miRNA transfection experiments (see Methods).	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

Nonfunctional target sites were defined as those that had a low posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or whose associated transcripts or proteins did not respond in miRNA transfection experiments.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

For each target site, we computed 32 properties that quantify the structure and sequence context of miRNA binding sites (listed in section 1.2 of the Supplemental Material).	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

In particular, U-rich and structurally accessible environments characterize functional miRNA target sites, irrespective of their location in CDS or 3' UTRs.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

mRNA destabilization occurs mainly when miRNAs bind to sites in 3' UTRs To investigate the possible function of CDS-located miRNA target sites, we first compiled, from the miRNA transfection experiments of Linsley et al. (2007) and Grimson et al. (2007), transcripts that satisfied one of the following four mutually exclusive constraints.	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

CDS binding sites can effectively inhibit translation Although miRNAs significantly reduce the mRNA levels of their targets (Bagga et al. 2005; Lewis et al. 2005), the initial paradigm was that miRNAs inhibit translation without affecting mRNA levels (Lee et al. 1993; Wightman et al. 1993), and the relative contribution of these mechanisms is still a matter of debate (Eulalio et al. 2008; Filipowicz et al. 2008; Béthune et al. 2012; David 2012).	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

As shown in Figure 5 and previously reported by Guo et al. (2010), transcripts that are targeted in the 3' UTR are strongly down-regulated at 32 h after transfection, and their ribosome occupancy at this time largely reflects the mRNA level.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

Finally, we constructed reporters to measure the effect of a miRNA on the protein and mRNA level of miRNA targets with CDS-located target sites.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

We then selected two conserved CDS miR-124 target sites that were represented with a relatively high number of reads in the EIF2C2 (also known as Ago2) CLIP data of Hafner et al. (2010).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Another recurrent finding is that changes in target mRNA level upon miRNA transfection or overexpression are small.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

How these small effects can confer a selective advantage that is reflected in the strong evolutionary conservation of the target sites remains a puzzle.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

This applies especially to target sites located in coding regions, whose effects appear to be substantially smaller compared with those in 3' UTRs (Gu et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010; Schnall-Levin et al. 2010, 2011; Fang and Rajewsky 2011).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

In the Bazzini et al. (2012) data, however, what is observed is preferential stabilization of known dre-miR-430 targets, which suggests either a direct involvement of miRNA-dependent regulation or an indirect correlation caused by the overlap between the set of mRNAs that undergo polyadenylation changes in development and the set of dre-miR-430 targets.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

On one side of the spectrum are miRNAs expressed in the embryonic cells and miRNAs of the miR-17-92 cluster, that target predominantly 3' UTRs, but also show the strongest enrichment in CDS–3' UTR co-targeting.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

This suggests that these miRNAs strongly and robustly down-regulate target genes, for example at developmental transitions.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

Previous Section Next Section Methods  Estimation of the selection pressure on CDS and 3' UTR target sites In a previous study, we introduced the ElMMo model for inferring miRNA target sites based on comparative genomics data (Gaidatzis et al. 2007).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

ElMMo predicts miRNA target site by estimating the selection pressure on motifs that are complementary to specific miRNAs, relative to a “background” set of motifs that do not correspond to miRNAs.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

To answer this question, we determined the number of genes that contained both one of the 250 highest-scoring CDS binding sites and one of the 250 highest-scoring 3' UTR sites for a given miRNA, as predicted by the ElMMo algorithm.	|	gene	|	site	|	bind

We then determined the fold enrichments in the number of such co-targeted genes relative to what would be expected if miRNAs targeted the CDS and the 3' UTR independently (see section “Enrichments in the number of genes co-targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR” in Methods).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

The tendency for these miRNAs to target both the CDS and the 3' UTR of individual mRNAs cannot be explained by a general tendency of motif co-occurrence in the CDS and 3' UTR of the same transcripts because co-targeting enrichments beyond threefold are very rarely observed for random motifs (Supplemental Fig. 11).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Interestingly, overexpression of most of these CDS/3' UTR-co-targeting miRNAs has been linked with tumorigenesis (Voorhoeve et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2008; Olive et al. 2009; Mateescu et al. 2011; Shi et al. 2011).	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene

These findings suggest that CDS and 3' UTR sites function through similar mechanisms and have a comparable impact on gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

This may reflect another unsuspected complexity of the kinetics of miRNA-dependent gene regulation (Bazzini et al. 2012; Béthune et al. 2012; Djuranovic et al. 2012).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

There is growing evidence that plant miRNAs can induce translational repression via imperfect complementarity interactions with target sites in CDS and 3' UTRs (Brodersen et al. 2008; Lanet et al. 2009).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

If CDS sites are as common as Argonaute cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) studies indicate (Chi et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010), one wonders why there are relatively few reports on their involvement in gene regulation and why the studies that have been so far published suggest that CDS sites are much less effective in down-regulating mRNA levels upon miRNA transfection (Baek et al. 2008; Hafner et al. 2010; Fang and Rajewsky 2011; Schnall-Levin et al. 2011).	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	ec

A reason may be that CDS sites function in specific contexts, in which coding regions are accessible to the miRNA-loaded silencing complex, while under normal conditions the process of translation hinders miRNA binding to these sites (Bartel 2009; Gu et al. 2009).	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

For instance, it has recently been found that hsa-miR-181a targets multiple members of the C2H2 zinc finger domain family, through multiple CDS sites that occur precisely in the regions of the transcripts that encode the C2H2 domains (Schnall-Levin et al. 2011).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Evolutionary conservation has been successfully employed to predict regulatory elements, including binding sites for miRNAs in 3' UTRs (Krek et al. 2005; Lewis et al. 2005; Gaidatzis et al. 2007).	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

Schnall-Levin et al. (2010) allowed for the possibility that sites are not perfectly conserved among “all” genomes used in the inference to show that miRNA targeting in CDS is as common as in the 3' UTRs in Drosophila species.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

They further predicted 26,000 and 14,000 sites in human 3' UTR and CDS regions, respectively.	|	site	|	human	|	ec

Finally, Fang and Rajewsky (2011) found evidence that mRNAs that are simultaneously targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR are slightly more destabilized than mRNA targeted only in the 3' UTR, while Schnall-Levin et al. (2011) showed that mRNAs with several miRNA binding sites in the CDS can effectively be degraded.	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

The target sites that we used in our analysis were either predicted computationally or inferred on the basis of transcript- or protein-level changes following miRNA transfections.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

Previous Section Next Section Results  Both CDS and 3' UTR sites are under evolutionary selection The application of the ElMMo model to miRNA target prediction in 3' UTRs was described before (Gaidatzis et al. 2007) and recent assessments indicate that ElMMo is among the most accurate miRNA target prediction methods available (Alexiou et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010; Sturm et al. 2010).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

ElMMo is parameter-free and, by building its background model from the appropriate type of regions, it can in principle predict miRNA target sites in transcript or genomic regions that do not correspond to 3' UTRs.	|	target	|	site	|	free

To determine whether the ElMMo-predicted CDS sites are functional we analyzed eight published data sets (listed in Table 1) that compared mRNA expression before and after transfections of individual miRNAs.	|	express	|	site	|	ec

As Figure 1A (and Supplemental Fig. 1) shows, both CDS and 3' UTR sites that are located in down-regulated transcripts have a higher probability to be under selection compared with sites that are located in transcripts that do not respond to transfection.	|	site	|	regul	|	ec

In principle, these transcripts were expressed and bound by Argonaute proteins, so the transfected miRNAs should have had access to all seed-matching sites in these transcripts.	|	express	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

(A) CDS- and 3' UTR-located miRNA binding sites that induce mRNA degradation or are isolated in EIF2C2 CLIP experiments are under stronger selection pressure compared with miRNA-complementary sites that were not functional in these experiments; 2274 CDS- and 3956 3' UTR-located sites that induce mRNA degradation are compared with 3513 CDS- and 3268 3' UTR-located sites that do not induce mRNA degradation; 751 CDS- and 786 3' UTR-located sites isolated in EIF2C2 CLIP experiments are compared with 1059 CDS- and 956 3' UTR-located sites that do not induce EIF2C2 binding.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

ElMMo further estimates a miRNA-specific probability that a site that is complementary to the miRNA in the reference species (in this case human) is under selection in at least one other species taken into account in the miRNA target prediction.	|	target	|	site	|	human	|	ec

miRNAs that function in embryonic development co-target the 3' UTR and the CDS The proportion of miRNA-complementary sites estimated to be under evolutionary selection in CDS as opposed to 3' UTRs differs between miRNAs (Fig. 2A).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

To answer this question, we determined the number of genes that contained both one of the 250 highest-scoring CDS binding sites and one of the 250 highest-scoring 3' UTR sites for a given miRNA, as predicted by the ElMMo algorithm.	|	gene	|	site	|	bind

The x-axis shows the preference of the miRNA for CDS vs. 3' UTR targeting defined as the signed distance to the line representing the scaling between the number of CDS and 3' UTR sites (Fig. 2A) for the respective miRNA.	|	target	|	site	|	line	|	ec

Functional CDS and 3' UTR binding sites have similar sequence and structure properties Previously, we found that miRNA binding sites that are located in 3' UTRs and are effective in mRNA degradation have specific properties such as structural accessibility and a U-rich sequence context (Hausser et al. 2009).	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

We further found that highly conserved miRNA target sites share these properties, suggesting that miRNA target sites in 3' UTRs have been selected in evolution based on their ability to induce mRNA degradation.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Functional target sites were defined as those that had a high posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or those whose associated transcripts or proteins responded in miRNA transfection experiments (see Methods).	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

Nonfunctional target sites were defined as those that had a low posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or whose associated transcripts or proteins did not respond in miRNA transfection experiments.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

For each target site, we computed 32 properties that quantify the structure and sequence context of miRNA binding sites (listed in section 1.2 of the Supplemental Material).	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

In particular, U-rich and structurally accessible environments characterize functional miRNA target sites, irrespective of their location in CDS or 3' UTRs.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

The correlation is considerably smaller for sites obtained based on measurement of protein expression changes for reasons that are presently unknown (Hausser et al. 2009).	|	express	|	site	|	protein

Sets of functional and nonfunctional binding sites were defined according to four different criteria—selective pressure, efficacy in mRNA degradation, efficacy in reducing protein levels, and binding to EIF2C2—each corresponding to a different panel.	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec

Positive and negative values denote positive and negative predictors of functional miRNA binding sites, respectively.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

mRNA destabilization occurs mainly when miRNAs bind to sites in 3' UTRs To investigate the possible function of CDS-located miRNA target sites, we first compiled, from the miRNA transfection experiments of Linsley et al. (2007) and Grimson et al. (2007), transcripts that satisfied one of the following four mutually exclusive constraints.	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Fold changes were normalized to the average fold change of mRNAs that did not contain canonical binding sites to the transfected miRNA.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

CDS binding sites can effectively inhibit translation Although miRNAs significantly reduce the mRNA levels of their targets (Bagga et al. 2005; Lewis et al. 2005), the initial paradigm was that miRNAs inhibit translation without affecting mRNA levels (Lee et al. 1993; Wightman et al. 1993), and the relative contribution of these mechanisms is still a matter of debate (Eulalio et al. 2008; Filipowicz et al. 2008; Béthune et al. 2012; David 2012).	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

They found that at 32 h post-transfection, the reduction in ribosome occupancy of transcripts with miRNA binding sites in 3' UTRs could be attributed in very large measure (84%) to the reduction in mRNA levels.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

This suggests that miRNA binding sites that are located in CDS are effective in inducing translational inhibition immediately after miRNA transfection while sites located in the 3' UTR sites are effective in down-regulating the mRNA levels.	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

CDS-located binding sites transiently inhibit translation in miRNA transfection experiments.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

To assess the generality of these findings we revisited the data from a very recent study that investigated the miRNA-induced translational inhibition and mRNA degradation during maternal-zygotic transition in zebrafish (Bazzini et al. 2012).	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

As shown in Supplemental Figure 15, the expression levels of mRNAs with CDS sites change very little upon knockout of miR-223 whereas their translation increases in the absence of the miRNA to a degree comparable to the translation of transcripts with binding sites in 3' UTRs.	|	express	|	site	|	bind

Finally, we constructed reporters to measure the effect of a miRNA on the protein and mRNA level of miRNA targets with CDS-located target sites.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

We then selected two conserved CDS miR-124 target sites that were represented with a relatively high number of reads in the EIF2C2 (also known as Ago2) CLIP data of Hafner et al. (2010).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Thus, in human, mouse and zebrafish, CDS-located miRNA binding sites appear to be more effective in translational inhibition than in mRNA degradation.	|	site	|	bind	|	human	|	ec

How these small effects can confer a selective advantage that is reflected in the strong evolutionary conservation of the target sites remains a puzzle.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

This applies especially to target sites located in coding regions, whose effects appear to be substantially smaller compared with those in 3' UTRs (Gu et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010; Schnall-Levin et al. 2010, 2011; Fang and Rajewsky 2011).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

We thus predicted miRNA binding sites in CDS and used them to comparatively investigate the properties and effects of miRNA-complementary sites that are located in the coding domain or in the 3' UTR.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

These findings suggest that CDS and 3' UTR sites function through similar mechanisms and have a comparable impact on gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

For the first time, our analysis of such data reveals an effect that CDS-located miRNA binding sites are capable of inducing more effectively than 3' UTR-located sites, namely a rapid reduction in mRNA translation.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Interestingly, in both the zebrafish system and our reporter system, some mRNAs with miRNA binding sites in coding regions appear to be up-regulated upon miRNA expression.	|	express	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

These miRNAs appear to preferentially bind to CDS-located sites, which we found to be effective in rapid inhibition of translation.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Previous Section Next Section Methods  Estimation of the selection pressure on CDS and 3' UTR target sites In a previous study, we introduced the ElMMo model for inferring miRNA target sites based on comparative genomics data (Gaidatzis et al. 2007).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

ElMMo is parameter-free, requiring only a set of miRNA-complementary, putative sites in a reference species and pairwise genome alignments between the reference species and other species.	|	site	|	free	|	ec

ElMMo predicts miRNA target site by estimating the selection pressure on motifs that are complementary to specific miRNAs, relative to a “background” set of motifs that do not correspond to miRNAs.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

By simply changing the type of sequences in the input data set (coding regions or 3' UTRs), ElMMo thus allows us to independently estimate the selection pressure on binding sites for individual miRNAs in CDS and 3' UTRs, respectively.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

We used human as the reference species, and the RefSeq data set of human transcripts downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as the set of transcripts in which we predicted target sites.	|	target	|	site	|	human	|	ec

mRNAs were then divided into four subsets: those with no binding sites to the transfected miRNA, those with exactly one binding site located in the 3' UTR, those with exactly one binding site located in the CDS, and mRNAs with two binding sites in the CDS.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

The overall effect of the transfected miRNA on rpf and mRNA levels was estimated by subtracting the log2 fold change of mRNAs without binding sites from that of mRNAs with binding sites (defined as above).	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

(2011) Outline of the statistical model For each of the c sites yielded by the CLIP experiment, we compare the observed number of CLIP reads ri with the number of reads expected under a background model in which the number of reads per CLIP site depends only on the abundance of the corresponding mRNA.	|	site	|	line	|	ec

We neglect biases related to sequence accessibility, sequence composition, etc. Instead, we will focus on how CLIP sites located on mRNAs of different abundance are sampled in a thought experiment in which all CLIP sites are equally prone to bind the RNA-binding protein of interest and generate reads.	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec

Our study suggests that miRNAs may combine targeting of CDS and 3' UTR to flexibly tune the time scale and magnitude of their post-transcriptional regulatory effects.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~21 nt (nucleotide)-long regulatory RNAs that are encoded in the genomes of species ranging from viruses to human.	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

They form miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) with Argonaute proteins which they guide, through hybridization, to target mRNAs whose expression is subsequently down-regulated (Bushati and Cohen 2007; Bartel 2009).	|	express	|	target	|	regul	|	protein

If CDS sites are as common as Argonaute cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) studies indicate (Chi et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010), one wonders why there are relatively few reports on their involvement in gene regulation and why the studies that have been so far published suggest that CDS sites are much less effective in down-regulating mRNA levels upon miRNA transfection (Baek et al. 2008; Hafner et al. 2010; Fang and Rajewsky 2011; Schnall-Levin et al. 2011).	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	ec

As shown in Figure 5 and previously reported by Guo et al. (2010), transcripts that are targeted in the 3' UTR are strongly down-regulated at 32 h after transfection, and their ribosome occupancy at this time largely reflects the mRNA level.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

This suggests that miRNA binding sites that are located in CDS are effective in inducing translational inhibition immediately after miRNA transfection while sites located in the 3' UTR sites are effective in down-regulating the mRNA levels.	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

Interestingly, in both the zebrafish system and our reporter system, some mRNAs with miRNA binding sites in coding regions appear to be up-regulated upon miRNA expression.	|	express	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

This may reflect another unsuspected complexity of the kinetics of miRNA-dependent gene regulation (Bazzini et al. 2012; Béthune et al. 2012; Djuranovic et al. 2012).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

In the Bazzini et al. (2012) data, however, what is observed is preferential stabilization of known dre-miR-430 targets, which suggests either a direct involvement of miRNA-dependent regulation or an indirect correlation caused by the overlap between the set of mRNAs that undergo polyadenylation changes in development and the set of dre-miR-430 targets.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

This suggests that these miRNAs strongly and robustly down-regulate target genes, for example at developmental transitions.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

Analysis of CDS-located miRNA target sites suggests that they can effectively inhibit translation Jean Hausser1, Afzal Pasha Syed, Biter Bilen and Mihaela Zavolan1 + Author Affiliations  Biozentrum, University of Basel and Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 4056 Basel, Switzerland   Next Section Abstract  Most of what is presently known about how miRNAs regulate gene expression comes from studies that characterized the regulatory effect of miRNA binding sites located in the 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of mRNAs.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that miRNAs also bind in the coding region (CDS), but the implication of these interactions remains obscure because they have a smaller impact on mRNA stability compared with miRNA-target interactions that involve 3' UTRs.	|	target	|	bind	|	ec

A reason may be that CDS sites function in specific contexts, in which coding regions are accessible to the miRNA-loaded silencing complex, while under normal conditions the process of translation hinders miRNA binding to these sites (Bartel 2009; Gu et al. 2009).	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Evolutionary conservation has been successfully employed to predict regulatory elements, including binding sites for miRNAs in 3' UTRs (Krek et al. 2005; Lewis et al. 2005; Gaidatzis et al. 2007).	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

Finally, Fang and Rajewsky (2011) found evidence that mRNAs that are simultaneously targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR are slightly more destabilized than mRNA targeted only in the 3' UTR, while Schnall-Levin et al. (2011) showed that mRNAs with several miRNA binding sites in the CDS can effectively be degraded.	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

(A) CDS- and 3' UTR-located miRNA binding sites that induce mRNA degradation or are isolated in EIF2C2 CLIP experiments are under stronger selection pressure compared with miRNA-complementary sites that were not functional in these experiments; 2274 CDS- and 3956 3' UTR-located sites that induce mRNA degradation are compared with 3513 CDS- and 3268 3' UTR-located sites that do not induce mRNA degradation; 751 CDS- and 786 3' UTR-located sites isolated in EIF2C2 CLIP experiments are compared with 1059 CDS- and 956 3' UTR-located sites that do not induce EIF2C2 binding.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

To answer this question, we determined the number of genes that contained both one of the 250 highest-scoring CDS binding sites and one of the 250 highest-scoring 3' UTR sites for a given miRNA, as predicted by the ElMMo algorithm.	|	gene	|	site	|	bind

Functional CDS and 3' UTR binding sites have similar sequence and structure properties Previously, we found that miRNA binding sites that are located in 3' UTRs and are effective in mRNA degradation have specific properties such as structural accessibility and a U-rich sequence context (Hausser et al. 2009).	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

For each target site, we computed 32 properties that quantify the structure and sequence context of miRNA binding sites (listed in section 1.2 of the Supplemental Material).	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Sets of functional and nonfunctional binding sites were defined according to four different criteria—selective pressure, efficacy in mRNA degradation, efficacy in reducing protein levels, and binding to EIF2C2—each corresponding to a different panel.	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec

Positive and negative values denote positive and negative predictors of functional miRNA binding sites, respectively.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

mRNA destabilization occurs mainly when miRNAs bind to sites in 3' UTRs To investigate the possible function of CDS-located miRNA target sites, we first compiled, from the miRNA transfection experiments of Linsley et al. (2007) and Grimson et al. (2007), transcripts that satisfied one of the following four mutually exclusive constraints.	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Fold changes were normalized to the average fold change of mRNAs that did not contain canonical binding sites to the transfected miRNA.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

CDS binding sites can effectively inhibit translation Although miRNAs significantly reduce the mRNA levels of their targets (Bagga et al. 2005; Lewis et al. 2005), the initial paradigm was that miRNAs inhibit translation without affecting mRNA levels (Lee et al. 1993; Wightman et al. 1993), and the relative contribution of these mechanisms is still a matter of debate (Eulalio et al. 2008; Filipowicz et al. 2008; Béthune et al. 2012; David 2012).	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

They found that at 32 h post-transfection, the reduction in ribosome occupancy of transcripts with miRNA binding sites in 3' UTRs could be attributed in very large measure (84%) to the reduction in mRNA levels.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

This suggests that miRNA binding sites that are located in CDS are effective in inducing translational inhibition immediately after miRNA transfection while sites located in the 3' UTR sites are effective in down-regulating the mRNA levels.	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

CDS-located binding sites transiently inhibit translation in miRNA transfection experiments.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

As shown in Supplemental Figure 15, the expression levels of mRNAs with CDS sites change very little upon knockout of miR-223 whereas their translation increases in the absence of the miRNA to a degree comparable to the translation of transcripts with binding sites in 3' UTRs.	|	express	|	site	|	bind

Thus, in human, mouse and zebrafish, CDS-located miRNA binding sites appear to be more effective in translational inhibition than in mRNA degradation.	|	site	|	bind	|	human	|	ec

We thus predicted miRNA binding sites in CDS and used them to comparatively investigate the properties and effects of miRNA-complementary sites that are located in the coding domain or in the 3' UTR.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

For the first time, our analysis of such data reveals an effect that CDS-located miRNA binding sites are capable of inducing more effectively than 3' UTR-located sites, namely a rapid reduction in mRNA translation.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Interestingly, in both the zebrafish system and our reporter system, some mRNAs with miRNA binding sites in coding regions appear to be up-regulated upon miRNA expression.	|	express	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

These miRNAs appear to preferentially bind to CDS-located sites, which we found to be effective in rapid inhibition of translation.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Future work will determine the magnitude and timing of gene repression induced by miRNAs binding to the coding regions to uncover new aspects of miRNA biology.	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec

By simply changing the type of sequences in the input data set (coding regions or 3' UTRs), ElMMo thus allows us to independently estimate the selection pressure on binding sites for individual miRNAs in CDS and 3' UTRs, respectively.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

mRNAs were then divided into four subsets: those with no binding sites to the transfected miRNA, those with exactly one binding site located in the 3' UTR, those with exactly one binding site located in the CDS, and mRNAs with two binding sites in the CDS.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

The overall effect of the transfected miRNA on rpf and mRNA levels was estimated by subtracting the log2 fold change of mRNAs without binding sites from that of mRNAs with binding sites (defined as above).	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

In case several miRNAs mapped to a binding site, the site was assigned to most highly expressed miRNA.	|	express	|	site	|	bind

We neglect biases related to sequence accessibility, sequence composition, etc. Instead, we will focus on how CLIP sites located on mRNAs of different abundance are sampled in a thought experiment in which all CLIP sites are equally prone to bind the RNA-binding protein of interest and generate reads.	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec

To obtain nonfunctional binding sites, we selected those transcripts with the smallest sum of squared log2 fold changes in the biological replicates.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Enrichments in the number of genes co-targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR To determine whether individual miRNAs tend to target the same genes in the CDS and in the 3' UTR more than expected by chance, we determined, for each miRNA, the number c11 of genes containing at least one of the top 250 CDS and at least one of the 250 top 3' UTR binding sites predicted by ElMMo.	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

In addition, we also determined the number c10 of genes containing at least one of the top 250 CDS binding sites, but not any of the 250 predicted 3' UTR binding sites.	|	gene	|	site	|	bind

ElMMo further estimates a miRNA-specific probability that a site that is complementary to the miRNA in the reference species (in this case human) is under selection in at least one other species taken into account in the miRNA target prediction.	|	target	|	site	|	human	|	ec

We found significant evidence of CDS and 3' UTR co-targeting for 62 human miRNAs (P < 0.05 at Fisher's exact test after Bonferroni correction; see Supplemental Table 2).	|	target	|	human	|	ec

Thus, in human, mouse and zebrafish, CDS-located miRNA binding sites appear to be more effective in translational inhibition than in mRNA degradation.	|	site	|	bind	|	human	|	ec

They form miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) with Argonaute proteins which they guide, through hybridization, to target mRNAs whose expression is subsequently down-regulated (Bushati and Cohen 2007; Bartel 2009).	|	express	|	target	|	regul	|	protein

The target sites that we used in our analysis were either predicted computationally or inferred on the basis of transcript- or protein-level changes following miRNA transfections.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

In principle, these transcripts were expressed and bound by Argonaute proteins, so the transfected miRNAs should have had access to all seed-matching sites in these transcripts.	|	express	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

Functional target sites were defined as those that had a high posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or those whose associated transcripts or proteins responded in miRNA transfection experiments (see Methods).	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

Nonfunctional target sites were defined as those that had a low posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or whose associated transcripts or proteins did not respond in miRNA transfection experiments.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

The correlation is considerably smaller for sites obtained based on measurement of protein expression changes for reasons that are presently unknown (Hausser et al. 2009).	|	express	|	site	|	protein

Sets of functional and nonfunctional binding sites were defined according to four different criteria—selective pressure, efficacy in mRNA degradation, efficacy in reducing protein levels, and binding to EIF2C2—each corresponding to a different panel.	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec

Finally, we constructed reporters to measure the effect of a miRNA on the protein and mRNA level of miRNA targets with CDS-located target sites.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

As shown in Supplemental Figure 17, wild-type constructs exhibit a reduction in protein expression relative to the mutant constructs that cannot be explained by a corresponding decrease in mRNA levels.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Recent high-throughput studies concluded that the reduction in protein levels upon miRNA expression is largely a consequence of the mRNA degradation induced by miRNAs (Baek et al. 2008; Selbach et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2010), though these initial experiments may have missed an important kinetic aspect (Bazzini et al. 2012).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Furthermore, proteomics measurements require that the proteins are labeled and this imposes constraints on the timing of miRNA transfection (or induction of expression).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

If CDS sites are as common as Argonaute cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) studies indicate (Chi et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010), one wonders why there are relatively few reports on their involvement in gene regulation and why the studies that have been so far published suggest that CDS sites are much less effective in down-regulating mRNA levels upon miRNA transfection (Baek et al. 2008; Hafner et al. 2010; Fang and Rajewsky 2011; Schnall-Levin et al. 2011).	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	ec

A reason may be that CDS sites function in specific contexts, in which coding regions are accessible to the miRNA-loaded silencing complex, while under normal conditions the process of translation hinders miRNA binding to these sites (Bartel 2009; Gu et al. 2009).	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

For instance, it has recently been found that hsa-miR-181a targets multiple members of the C2H2 zinc finger domain family, through multiple CDS sites that occur precisely in the regions of the transcripts that encode the C2H2 domains (Schnall-Levin et al. 2011).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Schnall-Levin et al. (2010) allowed for the possibility that sites are not perfectly conserved among “all” genomes used in the inference to show that miRNA targeting in CDS is as common as in the 3' UTRs in Drosophila species.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

They further predicted 26,000 and 14,000 sites in human 3' UTR and CDS regions, respectively.	|	site	|	human	|	ec

Previous Section Next Section Results  Both CDS and 3' UTR sites are under evolutionary selection The application of the ElMMo model to miRNA target prediction in 3' UTRs was described before (Gaidatzis et al. 2007) and recent assessments indicate that ElMMo is among the most accurate miRNA target prediction methods available (Alexiou et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010; Sturm et al. 2010).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

To determine whether the ElMMo-predicted CDS sites are functional we analyzed eight published data sets (listed in Table 1) that compared mRNA expression before and after transfections of individual miRNAs.	|	express	|	site	|	ec

As Figure 1A (and Supplemental Fig. 1) shows, both CDS and 3' UTR sites that are located in down-regulated transcripts have a higher probability to be under selection compared with sites that are located in transcripts that do not respond to transfection.	|	site	|	regul	|	ec

In principle, these transcripts were expressed and bound by Argonaute proteins, so the transfected miRNAs should have had access to all seed-matching sites in these transcripts.	|	express	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

We then determined the fold enrichments in the number of such co-targeted genes relative to what would be expected if miRNAs targeted the CDS and the 3' UTR independently (see section “Enrichments in the number of genes co-targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR” in Methods).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

We found significant evidence of CDS and 3' UTR co-targeting for 62 human miRNAs (P < 0.05 at Fisher's exact test after Bonferroni correction; see Supplemental Table 2).	|	target	|	human	|	ec

Among these were many miRNAs with important functions: the epithelial cell-specific (Gregory et al. 2008) hsa-miR-141-3p/200a-3p (P < 10-11), the embryonic stem cell-expressed (Suh et al. 2004; Stadler et al. 2010) hsa-miR-302/372/373-3p/520a-3p (P < 10-8), the oncogenic component of the mir-17/92 cluster hsa-miR-19a-3p (P < 10-6) (Ventura et al. 2008; Olive et al. 2009), the oncogenic hsa-miR-130b-3p/hsa-miR-301a-3p miRNAs (P < 10-6) (Shi et al. 2011), and the hsa-miR-137 (P < 10-6), that is involved in neural maturation (Smrt et al. 2010; Sun et al. 2011).	|	express	|	ec	|	oncogen

The tendency for these miRNAs to target both the CDS and the 3' UTR of individual mRNAs cannot be explained by a general tendency of motif co-occurrence in the CDS and 3' UTR of the same transcripts because co-targeting enrichments beyond threefold are very rarely observed for random motifs (Supplemental Fig. 11).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

The x-axis shows the preference of the miRNA for CDS vs. 3' UTR targeting defined as the signed distance to the line representing the scaling between the number of CDS and 3' UTR sites (Fig. 2A) for the respective miRNA.	|	target	|	site	|	line	|	ec

We further found that highly conserved miRNA target sites share these properties, suggesting that miRNA target sites in 3' UTRs have been selected in evolution based on their ability to induce mRNA degradation.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Functional target sites were defined as those that had a high posterior probability of being under evolutionary selection or those whose associated transcripts or proteins responded in miRNA transfection experiments (see Methods).	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

For each target site, we computed 32 properties that quantify the structure and sequence context of miRNA binding sites (listed in section 1.2 of the Supplemental Material).	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

In particular, U-rich and structurally accessible environments characterize functional miRNA target sites, irrespective of their location in CDS or 3' UTRs.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

As shown in Figure 5 and previously reported by Guo et al. (2010), transcripts that are targeted in the 3' UTR are strongly down-regulated at 32 h after transfection, and their ribosome occupancy at this time largely reflects the mRNA level.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

This suggests that miRNA binding sites that are located in CDS are effective in inducing translational inhibition immediately after miRNA transfection while sites located in the 3' UTR sites are effective in down-regulating the mRNA levels.	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

CDS-located binding sites transiently inhibit translation in miRNA transfection experiments.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

The figure shows log2 fold changes in mRNA levels (mRNA-seq), and ribosome-protected fragments (rpf) 12 and 32 h after hsa-miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-1 transfection.	|	figur	|	fig	|	ec

To assess the generality of these findings we revisited the data from a very recent study that investigated the miRNA-induced translational inhibition and mRNA degradation during maternal-zygotic transition in zebrafish (Bazzini et al. 2012).	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

Finally, we constructed reporters to measure the effect of a miRNA on the protein and mRNA level of miRNA targets with CDS-located target sites.	|	target	|	site	|	protein	|	ec

First, we generated a HEK293T stable cell line containing an episomal pRTS-1 vector from which the expression of hsa-miR-124-3p can be induced with doxycyclin.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

We then selected two conserved CDS miR-124 target sites that were represented with a relatively high number of reads in the EIF2C2 (also known as Ago2) CLIP data of Hafner et al. (2010).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

As shown in Supplemental Figure 17, wild-type constructs exhibit a reduction in protein expression relative to the mutant constructs that cannot be explained by a corresponding decrease in mRNA levels.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Thus, in human, mouse and zebrafish, CDS-located miRNA binding sites appear to be more effective in translational inhibition than in mRNA degradation.	|	site	|	bind	|	human	|	ec

Recent high-throughput studies concluded that the reduction in protein levels upon miRNA expression is largely a consequence of the mRNA degradation induced by miRNAs (Baek et al. 2008; Selbach et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2010), though these initial experiments may have missed an important kinetic aspect (Bazzini et al. 2012).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Another recurrent finding is that changes in target mRNA level upon miRNA transfection or overexpression are small.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

How these small effects can confer a selective advantage that is reflected in the strong evolutionary conservation of the target sites remains a puzzle.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

This applies especially to target sites located in coding regions, whose effects appear to be substantially smaller compared with those in 3' UTRs (Gu et al. 2009; Hafner et al. 2010; Schnall-Levin et al. 2010, 2011; Fang and Rajewsky 2011).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

We thus predicted miRNA binding sites in CDS and used them to comparatively investigate the properties and effects of miRNA-complementary sites that are located in the coding domain or in the 3' UTR.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

These findings suggest that CDS and 3' UTR sites function through similar mechanisms and have a comparable impact on gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

Furthermore, proteomics measurements require that the proteins are labeled and this imposes constraints on the timing of miRNA transfection (or induction of expression).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

For the first time, our analysis of such data reveals an effect that CDS-located miRNA binding sites are capable of inducing more effectively than 3' UTR-located sites, namely a rapid reduction in mRNA translation.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

This may reflect another unsuspected complexity of the kinetics of miRNA-dependent gene regulation (Bazzini et al. 2012; Béthune et al. 2012; Djuranovic et al. 2012).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

In the Bazzini et al. (2012) data, however, what is observed is preferential stabilization of known dre-miR-430 targets, which suggests either a direct involvement of miRNA-dependent regulation or an indirect correlation caused by the overlap between the set of mRNAs that undergo polyadenylation changes in development and the set of dre-miR-430 targets.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

On one side of the spectrum are miRNAs expressed in the embryonic cells and miRNAs of the miR-17-92 cluster, that target predominantly 3' UTRs, but also show the strongest enrichment in CDS–3' UTR co-targeting.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

These miRNAs appear to preferentially bind to CDS-located sites, which we found to be effective in rapid inhibition of translation.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Future work will determine the magnitude and timing of gene repression induced by miRNAs binding to the coding regions to uncover new aspects of miRNA biology.	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec

Previous Section Next Section Methods  Estimation of the selection pressure on CDS and 3' UTR target sites In a previous study, we introduced the ElMMo model for inferring miRNA target sites based on comparative genomics data (Gaidatzis et al. 2007).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

ElMMo is parameter-free, requiring only a set of miRNA-complementary, putative sites in a reference species and pairwise genome alignments between the reference species and other species.	|	site	|	free	|	ec

ElMMo predicts miRNA target site by estimating the selection pressure on motifs that are complementary to specific miRNAs, relative to a “background” set of motifs that do not correspond to miRNAs.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

By simply changing the type of sequences in the input data set (coding regions or 3' UTRs), ElMMo thus allows us to independently estimate the selection pressure on binding sites for individual miRNAs in CDS and 3' UTRs, respectively.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

We used human as the reference species, and the RefSeq data set of human transcripts downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) as the set of transcripts in which we predicted target sites.	|	target	|	site	|	human	|	ec

For the analysis, we only considered 10,222 genes with nonzero expression levels in all experimental conditions (mock, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-miR-1 transfections/mRNA and rpf sequencing/0, 12, and 32 h after transfection).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

mRNAs were then divided into four subsets: those with no binding sites to the transfected miRNA, those with exactly one binding site located in the 3' UTR, those with exactly one binding site located in the CDS, and mRNAs with two binding sites in the CDS.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

The overall effect of the transfected miRNA on rpf and mRNA levels was estimated by subtracting the log2 fold change of mRNAs without binding sites from that of mRNAs with binding sites (defined as above).	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

mRNA site extraction from the EIF2C2 CLIP experiments of Kishore et al. (2011) Outline of the statistical model For each of the c sites yielded by the CLIP experiment, we compare the observed number of CLIP reads ri with the number of reads expected under a background model in which the number of reads per CLIP site depends only on the abundance of the corresponding mRNA.	|	site	|	line	|	ec

We neglect biases related to sequence accessibility, sequence composition, etc. Instead, we will focus on how CLIP sites located on mRNAs of different abundance are sampled in a thought experiment in which all CLIP sites are equally prone to bind the RNA-binding protein of interest and generate reads.	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec

By applying the same reasoning to P(ri|r, H0), one can show the denominator of Equation 7 to be Formula(11)  Finally, substituting Equations 10 and 11 into Equation 7 gives a simple expression for the posterior probability P(H1|r, ri) that the number of CLIP reads ri mapping to site i is larger than what would be expected given the abundance of the mRNA alone: Formula which is the reverse cumulative probability of a Beta distribution.	|	express	|	site	|	ec

To obtain binding sites, 40-nt windows are ranked by decreasing posterior probability first, and in the case of ties, by decreasing enrichment ratios Graphic.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Finally, predictions of miRNA binding sites under selection pressure are available as flat files from http://www.mirz.unibas.ch/miRNAtargetPredictionBulk.php.	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Not knowing the distribution of the severity of the effect that miRNAs have on the expression of their targets we assumed as little as possible about the distribution Pk(f | +), namely that a true target must change expression in the right direction, i.e., f < 0 for a miRNA overexpression experiment, and that expression changes are limited to a finite range over which the expression change has a “uniform” distribution.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

To obtain nonfunctional binding sites, we selected those transcripts with the smallest sum of squared log2 fold changes in the biological replicates.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Extraction of functional and nonfunctional sites from ElMMo predictions From our predictions of miRNA target sites under evolutionary selection (Gaidatzis et al. 2007) and for each of the experimentally tested and evolutionarily conserved miRNAs (hsa-miR-30a-5p, hsa-let-7c, hsa-miR-155-5p, hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-103-3p, hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, hsa-miR-20a-5p, hsa-miR-141-3p, hsa-miR-200a-3p, hsa-miR-181a-5p, hsa-miR-124-3p and hsa-miR-17-5p), we selected the top 250 target sites in the order of their posterior probability of being under selection.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Enrichments in the number of genes co-targeted in the CDS and in the 3' UTR To determine whether individual miRNAs tend to target the same genes in the CDS and in the 3' UTR more than expected by chance, we determined, for each miRNA, the number c11 of genes containing at least one of the top 250 CDS and at least one of the 250 top 3' UTR binding sites predicted by ElMMo.	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Ketting A Dead End for MicroRNAs Cell, Volume 131, Issue 7, 28 December 2007, Pages 1226-1227  PDF (197 K)            Open Archive Summary MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are inhibitors of gene expression capable of controlling processes in normal development and cancer.	|	express	|	cancer	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Here we demonstrate that the expression of dead end 1 (Dnd1), an evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein (RBP), counteracts the function of several miRNAs in human cells and in primordial germ cells of zebrafish by binding mRNAs and prohibiting miRNAs from associating with their target sites.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	human	|	protein

These regulators of gene expression are capable of defining and altering cell fate.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul

Evidence suggests that miRNAs participate in the regulation of a large variety of cellular processes and that the vast majority of miRNAs show tissue or developmental stage-specific expression (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002, Lim et al., 2005 and Wienholds et al., 2005).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

In animals, miRNAs utilize a seed sequence at their 5? end (nt 2–8) to associate with 3?UTR regions of mRNAs to suppress gene expression by inhibiting translation that occasionally is associated with mRNA decay (Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Here we show that the RBP dead end 1 (Dnd1) prohibits miRNA-dependent inhibition of gene expression in human cells and in zebrafish primordial germ cells.	|	express	|	gene	|	human

Dnd1 had no effect on expression from either a construct encoding luciferase-p27 3?UTR that is mutated at the two miR-221 sites or on an empty luciferase reporter vector, suggesting that the increase in luciferase expression was not caused by a general effect on transcription or translation efficiency but rather was specific to miRNA-repressed translation.	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

An immunostaining with anti-HA antibody demonstrates the expression of huDnd1 while H2B-GFP was used to control transfection efficiency.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

To test whether the effect of Dnd1 on miRNA activity is specific and mediated through its RNA-binding domain, we used expression plasmids of Dnd1 homologs and related genes and found neither to significantly inhibit miR-221-mediated suppression of luciferase-p27 3?UTR (Figure 1D, expression controls shown in Figure S1E).	|	express	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

Suppression of gene expression by miRNAs is exerted by translational inhibition that occasionally is associated with mRNA decay (Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

To test the possible effect of Dnd1 on these pathways, we examined the endogenous p27 RNA and protein levels in HEK293 cells (expressing endogenous p27 and miR-221and -222, Figure 2C).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

To study endogenous Dnd1 function, we first tested by quantitative RT-PCR several human cancer cell lines for the expression of Dnd1 and found the teratoma Tera1 cell line to be positive.	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	line

Interestingly, Tera1 cells express high levels of the miR-372 family, which we have previously shown to target LATS2 through two sites at its 3?UTR (Figure S1B).	|	express	|	target	|	site

Figure 1H shows that transfection of shDnd1, but not a control vector, reduced the expression of a cotransfected luciferase LATS2 3?UTR reporter gene only when the miR-372 targeting sites were present.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

Altogether, these results indicate that endogenous Dnd1 in Tera1 cells protects the expression of endogenous LATS2 from being targeted by the miR-372 family.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

Western blot analysis with anti-HA confirmed the expression of human and zebrafish proteins, whereas nuclear Cdc6 and cytoplasmic Tubulin verified cellular fractionation (Figure 2A, bottom).	|	express	|	human	|	protein

We followed the expression changes of three germline specific genes: nanos1, TDRD7, and Vasa.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

The specific expression of nanos1 and TDRD7 in the PGCs is considered to be the result of miR-430-dependent inhibition in somatic cells, while Vasa regulation is miR-430 independent (Mishima et al., 2006).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

RNA was extracted from these embryos, and the endogenous levels of the germline-specific genes (nanos1, TDRD7, and Vasa) were compared to Odc1, a ubiquitously expressed gene.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Similar to the endogenous expression pattern, the injection of RNA, encoding a fluorescent marker gene fused to the 3?UTR of nanos1, TDRD7, or Vasa, into zebrafish embryos leads to preferential fluorescence in PGCs ( Koprunner et al. [2001] and data not shown).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Upon Dnd1 knockdown, quantitative pixel-intensity analysis shows a clear and significant reduction in red fluorescent signal (DsRed-nos1 3?UTR or DsRed-TDRD7 3?UTR), but not green (coinjected GFP-vasa 3?UTR) in PGCs ( Figures 3B and S2B), indicating that Dnd1 affects gene expression through the 3?UTR of nanos1 and TDRD7.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

We therefore compared the expression of marker genes fused to a wild-type or a mutated miR-430-targeting site in nos1 3?UTR and TDRD7 3?UTR.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site

We immunoprecipitated (IP) HA-tagged Dnd1, Dnd1(Y104C), or control proteins from HEK293 cells and incubated them with RNA purified from MCF-7 cells expressing control vector, wild-type, or mutant 1 luciferase-p27 3?UTR(196–300).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec	|	control

To test the in vivo relevance of URRs to Dnd1 function, we mutated URRs found within the zebrafish nos1 and TDRD7 3?UTRs and tested the effect of these mutations on gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Figure 5B shows that mut3 did not reduce gene expression when miR-430 target site was mutated, suggesting that also in this case Dnd1 effect is miRNA dependent.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

Figure options Mechanism of Dnd1 Function Our results point to a model by which Dnd1 positively regulates gene expression by prohibiting miRNA-mediated gene suppression.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

As HEK293T cells express miR-221, exogenous introduction of miR-221 results in only a slight effect on p27 expression, while introduction of human Dnd1 raises p27 levels (see also Figure 1C).	|	express	|	human	|	ec

Figure options Discussion In this study we provide evidence that primordial germ cells possess factors such as Dnd1 that protect the expression of several genes from repression by miRNAs, as exemplified by miR-430.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Similarly, the expression of LATS2, a target gene for the miR-372-family, is dependent on the expression of Dnd1 in Tera1, a human cell line derived from a germ-cell tumor that contains high levels of the miR-372 family.	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	line

First, as it affects protein synthesis and mRNA stability rather than controlling the expression of miRNAs in the cells, it is potentially a very rapid mechanism.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec	|	control

Fourth, this mechanism allows differential gene regulation in different tissues while keeping the expression of both miRNAs and mRNAs constant in the cell.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

One implication of this mode of regulation is that the presence of a miRNA and its target in the same tissue does not necessarily result in repression, therefore allowing coexpression of both miRNA and target mRNA.	|	express	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

For protein-expression analysis and immunoprecipitation HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using calcium-phosphate precipitation.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

MCF7- and Tera1 cells were transfected using PEI (Polysciences, Inc.) or Fugene (Roche), respectively, for luciferase analysis with 10 ng of reporter, 5 ng of renilla control plasmid, and 250 ng of either miR-Vec or miR-Vec control, and 250 ng of either miR-Vec control or expression plasmid for Dnd1 or homologs.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Here we demonstrate that the expression of dead end 1 (Dnd1), an evolutionary conserved RNA-binding protein (RBP), counteracts the function of several miRNAs in human cells and in primordial germ cells of zebrafish by binding mRNAs and prohibiting miRNAs from associating with their target sites.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	human	|	protein

Together, these observations indicate that the miRNA pathway can be controlled at different levels, from stability, processing, sequence identity, and binding to target mRNAs.	|	target	|	bind	|	control

Interestingly, Tera1 cells express high levels of the miR-372 family, which we have previously shown to target LATS2 through two sites at its 3?UTR (Figure S1B).	|	express	|	target	|	site

To directly measure the effect of endogenous Dnd1 on the activity of endogenous miR-372 family, we used sensor molecules containing the luciferase gene under the control of either wild-type LATS2-3?UTR or a mutant in the 372 target sites (le Sage et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve et al., 2006).	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

Figure 1H shows that transfection of shDnd1, but not a control vector, reduced the expression of a cotransfected luciferase LATS2 3?UTR reporter gene only when the miR-372 targeting sites were present.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

Altogether, these results indicate that endogenous Dnd1 in Tera1 cells protects the expression of endogenous LATS2 from being targeted by the miR-372 family.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

To test this option we converted one miR-221-targeting site in p27 3?UTR to an RNAi site (named FC, a full complementary region to miR-221) and mutated the seed of the second site ( Figure 2B).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

We therefore compared the expression of marker genes fused to a wild-type or a mutated miR-430-targeting site in nos1 3?UTR and TDRD7 3?UTR.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site

Quantitative pixel-intensity analysis showed that the reduction in fluorescence resulting from knocking down Dnd1 function was effectively suppressed by mutating the miR-430-targeting site ( Figures 3C and S2C).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

To test whether the effect of URR mutation was dependent on miRNA function, we introduced the mutation of the URR in the background of the miR-430 target-site mutant.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Figure 5B shows that mut3 did not reduce gene expression when miR-430 target site was mutated, suggesting that also in this case Dnd1 effect is miRNA dependent.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

To test this model we examined the direct interaction of miR-221 with its target p27 in human HEK293 cells, in the presence or absence of human Dnd1.	|	target	|	human	|	ec

Similarly, the expression of LATS2, a target gene for the miR-372-family, is dependent on the expression of Dnd1 in Tera1, a human cell line derived from a germ-cell tumor that contains high levels of the miR-372 family.	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	line

One implication of this mode of regulation is that the presence of a miRNA and its target in the same tissue does not necessarily result in repression, therefore allowing coexpression of both miRNA and target mRNA.	|	express	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

In animals, miRNAs utilize a seed sequence at their 5? end (nt 2–8) to associate with 3?UTR regions of mRNAs to suppress gene expression by inhibiting translation that occasionally is associated with mRNA decay (Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Importantly, it is becoming increasingly clear that during their biogenesis, the activity of miRNAs is subjected to intense regulation.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

As specific regions in the 3?UTR of these genes counteract their repression in germline cells, it is reasonable to assume that germ cell-specific factors bind and counteract miR-430 function in these cells.	|	gene	|	bind	|	line	|	ec

Here we show that the RBP dead end 1 (Dnd1) prohibits miRNA-dependent inhibition of gene expression in human cells and in zebrafish primordial germ cells.	|	express	|	gene	|	human

Results Dnd1 Relieves miRNA Repression in Human Germline Cells Using functional genetic-screening approaches, we have recently identified the miRNA-mRNA interactions between p27 and miR-221 and between LATS2 and miR-372 as promoting cancer (le Sage et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve et al., 2006).	|	cancer	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Dnd1 had no effect on expression from either a construct encoding luciferase-p27 3?UTR that is mutated at the two miR-221 sites or on an empty luciferase reporter vector, suggesting that the increase in luciferase expression was not caused by a general effect on transcription or translation efficiency but rather was specific to miRNA-repressed translation.	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

To test whether the effect of Dnd1 on miRNA activity is specific and mediated through its RNA-binding domain, we used expression plasmids of Dnd1 homologs and related genes and found neither to significantly inhibit miR-221-mediated suppression of luciferase-p27 3?UTR (Figure 1D, expression controls shown in Figure S1E).	|	express	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

Suppression of gene expression by miRNAs is exerted by translational inhibition that occasionally is associated with mRNA decay (Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

To directly measure the effect of endogenous Dnd1 on the activity of endogenous miR-372 family, we used sensor molecules containing the luciferase gene under the control of either wild-type LATS2-3?UTR or a mutant in the 372 target sites (le Sage et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve et al., 2006).	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

Figure 1H shows that transfection of shDnd1, but not a control vector, reduced the expression of a cotransfected luciferase LATS2 3?UTR reporter gene only when the miR-372 targeting sites were present.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

To examine the effects of Dnd1 on miR-221 biogenesis, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with vectors encoding either human or zebrafish Dnd1 and miR-221 or control miRNA, and subsequently subjected to subcellular fractionation, RNA isolation, and to an RNase protection assay (RPA) to detect cyclophilin control RNA and miR-221 precursor and mature forms.	|	gene	|	human	|	ec	|	control

We followed the expression changes of three germline specific genes: nanos1, TDRD7, and Vasa.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

RNA was extracted from these embryos, and the endogenous levels of the germline-specific genes (nanos1, TDRD7, and Vasa) were compared to Odc1, a ubiquitously expressed gene.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Then, we cloned the 3?UTRs of nanos1, TDRD7, and control Vasa downstream of fluorescence marker genes, to determine whether the Dnd1 effect is mediated through their 3?UTR.	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Similar to the endogenous expression pattern, the injection of RNA, encoding a fluorescent marker gene fused to the 3?UTR of nanos1, TDRD7, or Vasa, into zebrafish embryos leads to preferential fluorescence in PGCs ( Koprunner et al. [2001] and data not shown).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Upon Dnd1 knockdown, quantitative pixel-intensity analysis shows a clear and significant reduction in red fluorescent signal (DsRed-nos1 3?UTR or DsRed-TDRD7 3?UTR), but not green (coinjected GFP-vasa 3?UTR) in PGCs ( Figures 3B and S2B), indicating that Dnd1 affects gene expression through the 3?UTR of nanos1 and TDRD7.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

We therefore compared the expression of marker genes fused to a wild-type or a mutated miR-430-targeting site in nos1 3?UTR and TDRD7 3?UTR.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site

To more specifically address the role of the URRs, we generated two mutants: mutant 1, in which the two URRs were replaced by non-URRs, and mutant 2, where adjacent sequences were similarly mutated as control.	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

To test the in vivo relevance of URRs to Dnd1 function, we mutated URRs found within the zebrafish nos1 and TDRD7 3?UTRs and tested the effect of these mutations on gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Figure 5B shows that mut3 did not reduce gene expression when miR-430 target site was mutated, suggesting that also in this case Dnd1 effect is miRNA dependent.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

Figure options Discussion In this study we provide evidence that primordial germ cells possess factors such as Dnd1 that protect the expression of several genes from repression by miRNAs, as exemplified by miR-430.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Similarly, the expression of LATS2, a target gene for the miR-372-family, is dependent on the expression of Dnd1 in Tera1, a human cell line derived from a germ-cell tumor that contains high levels of the miR-372 family.	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	line

However, recently three protein-coding genes, from which two are RBPs and one miRNA, were identified to be candidate disease genes from the 129 strain (Zhu et al., 2007).	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

Additionally, a recent finding in C. elegans showed that disruption of the germ plasm by loss of two genes involved in RNA biology in these animals can also lead to the development of similar tumors ( Ciosk et al., 2006).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Our results demonstrate that loss of Dnd1 enhances miRNA repression of some genes that are essential for primordial germ-cell development ( Koprunner et al., 2001) (among them nanos1 and TDRD7) and predict that this mechanism can be responsible for defects in germ-cell survival or for tumor formation.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Interestingly, Tera1 cells express high levels of the miR-372 family, which we have previously shown to target LATS2 through two sites at its 3?UTR (Figure S1B).	|	express	|	target	|	site

To directly measure the effect of endogenous Dnd1 on the activity of endogenous miR-372 family, we used sensor molecules containing the luciferase gene under the control of either wild-type LATS2-3?UTR or a mutant in the 372 target sites (le Sage et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve et al., 2006).	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

To test this option we converted one miR-221-targeting site in p27 3?UTR to an RNAi site (named FC, a full complementary region to miR-221) and mutated the seed of the second site ( Figure 2B).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Figure 1F shows that transfection of either human or wild-type zebrafish Dnd1, but not the Y104C mutant, caused elevation in p27 mRNA (up to 1.5-fold) and protein (up to 5-fold), indicating that Dnd1 can potently block endogenous miR-221 and -222-mediated mRNA decay and translation inhibition.	|	human	|	protein	|	ec

To directly measure the effect of endogenous Dnd1 on the activity of endogenous miR-372 family, we used sensor molecules containing the luciferase gene under the control of either wild-type LATS2-3?UTR or a mutant in the 372 target sites (le Sage et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve et al., 2006).	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

Figure 1H shows that transfection of shDnd1, but not a control vector, reduced the expression of a cotransfected luciferase LATS2 3?UTR reporter gene only when the miR-372 targeting sites were present.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

Altogether, these results indicate that endogenous Dnd1 in Tera1 cells protects the expression of endogenous LATS2 from being targeted by the miR-372 family.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

To examine the effects of Dnd1 on miR-221 biogenesis, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with vectors encoding either human or zebrafish Dnd1 and miR-221 or control miRNA, and subsequently subjected to subcellular fractionation, RNA isolation, and to an RNase protection assay (RPA) to detect cyclophilin control RNA and miR-221 precursor and mature forms.	|	gene	|	human	|	ec	|	control

To test this option we converted one miR-221-targeting site in p27 3?UTR to an RNAi site (named FC, a full complementary region to miR-221) and mutated the seed of the second site ( Figure 2B).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

We followed the expression changes of three germline specific genes: nanos1, TDRD7, and Vasa.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

The specific expression of nanos1 and TDRD7 in the PGCs is considered to be the result of miR-430-dependent inhibition in somatic cells, while Vasa regulation is miR-430 independent (Mishima et al., 2006).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

RNA was extracted from these embryos, and the endogenous levels of the germline-specific genes (nanos1, TDRD7, and Vasa) were compared to Odc1, a ubiquitously expressed gene.	|	express	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Then, we cloned the 3?UTRs of nanos1, TDRD7, and control Vasa downstream of fluorescence marker genes, to determine whether the Dnd1 effect is mediated through their 3?UTR.	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Similar to the endogenous expression pattern, the injection of RNA, encoding a fluorescent marker gene fused to the 3?UTR of nanos1, TDRD7, or Vasa, into zebrafish embryos leads to preferential fluorescence in PGCs ( Koprunner et al. [2001] and data not shown).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Upon Dnd1 knockdown, quantitative pixel-intensity analysis shows a clear and significant reduction in red fluorescent signal (DsRed-nos1 3?UTR or DsRed-TDRD7 3?UTR), but not green (coinjected GFP-vasa 3?UTR) in PGCs ( Figures 3B and S2B), indicating that Dnd1 affects gene expression through the 3?UTR of nanos1 and TDRD7.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Quantitative pixel-intensity analysis showed that the reduction in fluorescence resulting from knocking down Dnd1 function was effectively suppressed by mutating the miR-430-targeting site ( Figures 3C and S2C).	|	target	|	site	|	ec

(C) One-cell-stage zebrafish embryos were coinjected with RNA containing the venus open-reading frame fused to the wild-type nanos1 3?UTR (3?nos1wt), RNA containing the cfp open-reading frame fused to the miR-430-binding site mutated nanos1 3?UTR (cfp-3?nos1mut1) and vasa-dsRed (for labeling the germinal granule for easier identification of germ cells) together with dead end morpholino or control morpholino.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

Our data suggest that these domains bind mRNAs at specific sites.	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

Superimposing the two homology-modeled domains in the structure of the similar Drosophila sex-lethal protein bound to uridine-rich single-stranded RNA indicated clearly that Dnd1 has all the hallmarks necessary to bind U-rich single-stranded RNA ( Handa et al., 1999).	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec

To more specifically address the role of the URRs, we generated two mutants: mutant 1, in which the two URRs were replaced by non-URRs, and mutant 2, where adjacent sequences were similarly mutated as control.	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

We immunoprecipitated (IP) HA-tagged Dnd1, Dnd1(Y104C), or control proteins from HEK293 cells and incubated them with RNA purified from MCF-7 cells expressing control vector, wild-type, or mutant 1 luciferase-p27 3?UTR(196–300).	|	express	|	protein	|	ec	|	control

To test the in vivo relevance of URRs to Dnd1 function, we mutated URRs found within the zebrafish nos1 and TDRD7 3?UTRs and tested the effect of these mutations on gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

To test whether the effect of URR mutation was dependent on miRNA function, we introduced the mutation of the URR in the background of the miR-430 target-site mutant.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Figure 5B shows that mut3 did not reduce gene expression when miR-430 target site was mutated, suggesting that also in this case Dnd1 effect is miRNA dependent.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

Figure options Mechanism of Dnd1 Function Our results point to a model by which Dnd1 positively regulates gene expression by prohibiting miRNA-mediated gene suppression.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

To test this model we examined the direct interaction of miR-221 with its target p27 in human HEK293 cells, in the presence or absence of human Dnd1.	|	target	|	human	|	ec

As HEK293T cells express miR-221, exogenous introduction of miR-221 results in only a slight effect on p27 expression, while introduction of human Dnd1 raises p27 levels (see also Figure 1C).	|	express	|	human	|	ec

Figure options Discussion In this study we provide evidence that primordial germ cells possess factors such as Dnd1 that protect the expression of several genes from repression by miRNAs, as exemplified by miR-430.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

These tumors resemble human testicular germ-cell tumors, which are the most common cancers affecting young men (Oosterhuis and Looijenga, 2005 and Youngren et al., 2005).	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

However, recently three protein-coding genes, from which two are RBPs and one miRNA, were identified to be candidate disease genes from the 129 strain (Zhu et al., 2007).	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

Additionally, a recent finding in C. elegans showed that disruption of the germ plasm by loss of two genes involved in RNA biology in these animals can also lead to the development of similar tumors ( Ciosk et al., 2006).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Our results demonstrate that loss of Dnd1 enhances miRNA repression of some genes that are essential for primordial germ-cell development ( Koprunner et al., 2001) (among them nanos1 and TDRD7) and predict that this mechanism can be responsible for defects in germ-cell survival or for tumor formation.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

First, as it affects protein synthesis and mRNA stability rather than controlling the expression of miRNAs in the cells, it is potentially a very rapid mechanism.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec	|	control

Fourth, this mechanism allows differential gene regulation in different tissues while keeping the expression of both miRNAs and mRNAs constant in the cell.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

One implication of this mode of regulation is that the presence of a miRNA and its target in the same tissue does not necessarily result in repression, therefore allowing coexpression of both miRNA and target mRNA.	|	express	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

For protein-expression analysis and immunoprecipitation HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using calcium-phosphate precipitation.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Germ cells are known to contain structures referred to as germ plasm that resemble P bodies; these contain an array of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) giving these cells unique control over translation and the stability of mRNA and proteins (Kotaja et al., 2006 and Kotaja and Sassone-Corsi, 2007).	|	bind	|	protein	|	control

Together, these observations indicate that the miRNA pathway can be controlled at different levels, from stability, processing, sequence identity, and binding to target mRNAs.	|	target	|	bind	|	control

An immunostaining with anti-HA antibody demonstrates the expression of huDnd1 while H2B-GFP was used to control transfection efficiency.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

(D and E) Similar to (B), only that several RBPs, as well as the zebrafish Dnd1 homolog (drDnd1) and a mutant in the RNA-binding domain (drDnd1Y104C), were cotransfected together with pGL3-p27-3?UTR and renilla luciferase control.	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

RNA was extracted from 80% of each IP and 5% from each input and subjected to RPA analysis to detect p27 and control cyclophilin mRNAs, human telomerase RNA (hTR), and miR-221.	|	human	|	ec	|	control

To test whether the effect of Dnd1 on miRNA activity is specific and mediated through its RNA-binding domain, we used expression plasmids of Dnd1 homologs and related genes and found neither to significantly inhibit miR-221-mediated suppression of luciferase-p27 3?UTR (Figure 1D, expression controls shown in Figure S1E).	|	express	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

To directly measure the effect of endogenous Dnd1 on the activity of endogenous miR-372 family, we used sensor molecules containing the luciferase gene under the control of either wild-type LATS2-3?UTR or a mutant in the 372 target sites (le Sage et al., 2007 and Voorhoeve et al., 2006).	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

Figure 1H shows that transfection of shDnd1, but not a control vector, reduced the expression of a cotransfected luciferase LATS2 3?UTR reporter gene only when the miR-372 targeting sites were present.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec	|	control

To examine the effects of Dnd1 on miR-221 biogenesis, MCF-7 cells were cotransfected with vectors encoding either human or zebrafish Dnd1 and miR-221 or control miRNA, and subsequently subjected to subcellular fractionation, RNA isolation, and to an RNase protection assay (RPA) to detect cyclophilin control RNA and miR-221 precursor and mature forms.	|	gene	|	human	|	ec	|	control

Endogenous miRNA was blocked using antagomirs and the effects on target expression and autophagy were analyzed.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

MIR376A shared the same seed sequence and had overlapping targets with MIR376B, and similarly blocked the expression of key autophagy proteins ATG4C and BECN1 (Beclin 1).	|	express	|	target	|	protein	|	ec

Lipid conjugated LC3 is necessary for the elongation of autophagic membranes and completion of the vesicles.[7] Indeed, cells lacking one of the conjugation reaction components were shown to harbor autophagy defects.[8]  Recent studies introduced microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel regulators of autophagy.[9], [10], [11] miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs serving as negative regulators of gene expression.[12] By base pairing with sequences found mainly in the 3? untranslated region (3?UTR) of specific mRNAs, miRNAs lead to mRNA instability and/or translation inhibition resulting in a decrease in target gene expression.[13] A single miRNA may target tens to hundreds of mRNAs, hence may co-regulate and coordinate a number of cellular proteins and pathways at once.[14] So far, only a handful of miRNAs were shown to directly affect the autophagic activity.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

Among them, MIR376B was introduced as a new regulator of starvation and mTOR-inhibition-related autophagy.[10] MIR376B blocked autophagy by affecting the expression of two key autophagy proteins, namely ATG4C and BECN1.	|	express	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

To confirm these results with a complementary technique, we analyzed the effect of MIR376A overexpression on the conversion of endogenous free LC3 protein (LC3-I) to its lipidated and autophagic vesicle-associated form (LC3-II).	|	express	|	free	|	protein	|	ec

Indeed, mRNA levels of both genes were decreased upon MIR376A overexpression (Figure 4C and D).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Additionally, MIR376A overexpression led to a decrease in the levels of both ATG4C (Figure 4E) and BECN1 (Figure 4F) proteins.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Therefore, similar to MIR376B, MIR376A could also regulate expression levels of two key proteins in the autophagy pathway.	|	express	|	regul	|	protein

Effect of MIR376A antagomirs on ATG4C and BECN1 levels  To check whether blockage of the endogenous miRNA would affect ATG4C and BECN1 expression levels, we used antagomirs (chemically engineered oligonucleotide anti-miRNAs) specifically neutralizing MIR376A.	|	express	|	utr	|	ec

According to Kawahara et.al (2007), miR-376 family members were transcribed as a long primary transcript.[17] Reports by Seitz et al. and Teferedegne et al. confirmed experimentally the presence of a common transcript including MIR376A and MIR376B.[16], [25] In line with these data, a recent study showed that the expression of MIR376A, MIR376B and MIR376C was regulated by a transcription factor called AIRE in a coordinated manner.[26] Although experimental confirmation is currently missing, our bioinformatics analyses revealed that predicted short promoter regions of these two miRNAs could be responsive to overlapping but different transcription factors, indicating that single miRNA transcripts could also co-exist (unpublished data by Ilknur Melis Durasi, Osman Ugur Sezerman and Devrim Gozuacik).	|	express	|	regul	|	line	|	ec

While MIR376B is highly expressed in the spleen and adrenal gland, MIR376A was reported to be abundant in the brain and uterus (Fig. S1).[30] A number of studies in the literature, showed the importance of MIR376A during development and differentiation-related events including erythroid differentiation [31], keratinocyte differentiation [32] and skeletal muscle development.[33] MIR376A was also shown to be upregulated during chemical and replicative senescence in human fibroblasts.[34]  Additionally, changes in MIR376 levels were observed under pathological conditions.	|	express	|	regul	|	human

While MIR376A was downregulated in esophageal cancer [35] and melanomas [36] and upregulated in salivary gland adenomas,[37] and pancreatic carcinomas,[38], [39] MIR376B was differentially expressed in uterine leiomyomas [40] and renal cell carcinomas.[41] Moreover, changes in MIR376A levels could be used as a marker to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, but MIR376B could serve as a breast cancer subtype marker.[42] Additionally, MIR376A and MIR376B were subjected to variable levels of editing in glioblastomas.[43]  Autophagy serves as a cellular defense mechanism against various pathogens including viruses.[44], [45] Not surprisingly, as a countermeasure, viruses evolved ways of modulating autophagy during productive and latent stages of the viral infection.[46] miRNAs of both viral and cellular origins were shown to affect cellular responses to viruses such as apoptosis, therefore, it is possible that autophagy-regulating miRNAs play a role in the battle between viruses and the host.	|	express	|	cancer	|	regul	|	ec

In line with a possible role of MIR376 family in virus-host interactions, a miRNA profiling revealed differential expression of MIR376A and MIR376B in control versus HIV-1 positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells.[47] In another study, an interesting interplay between viral miRNAs and MIR376A was reported.[48] MREs for MIR376A in the 3? UTR of the MICB mRNA (a stress-induced ligand necessary for host cell recognition and destruction by natural killer cells) overlapped with the MRE of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) miRNA, miR-K12-7.	|	express	|	line	|	ec	|	control

We showed that, miRNA response elements (MRE) in the 3?UTR region of these genes were direct targets of MIR376A.	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Although the nucleotide sequences of at least seven miRNA genes found in this region differed considerably, the seed sequences (around 8 nucleotide long miRNA core sequences responsible for target mRNA recognition) of MIR376A1, MIR376A2 and MIRB2 were identical to that of the MIR376B (Figure 1B and C).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Figure 5 Figure 5 Effect of antagomirs on MIR376A target expression.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

MIR376A directly targeted ATG4C and BECN1 3? UTR sequences  To prove that negative regulation of the autophagy proteins by MIR376A was a result of a direct effect of the miRNA, reporter luciferase vectors containing predicted 3? UTR MRE sequences in ATG4C and BECN1 mRNAs were prepared.	|	target	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

Since ATG4C and BECN1 function at two different steps of autophagic vesicle formation, targeting of both of these key autophagy proteins at once by the MIR376 family of miRNAs allows a robust decrease in the autophagic activity.	|	target	|	protein	|	ec

In fact, BECN1 was subject to regulation by transcriptional upregulation, protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation and ubiquitination.[19], [20], [21] ATG4 was also reported to be regulated in various ways including transcriptional upregulation and reactive oxygen species [22] Moreover, miRNAs other than MIR376 family were shown to target BECN1 or ATG4 as well.	|	target	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

Differential editing of MIR376 family members was reported in a number of tissues.[17] For example, while +44 site in the seed sequence of MIR376A was not edited in the mouse cortex, in the same tissue MIR376B was highly edited (around 50–60%) at this position.[17] Since editing in the seed region was shown to change target specificity of miRNAs including MIR376A*[17], [29] in addition to relative ratios of MIR376A and MIR376B, ratios between edited versus non-edited versions of MIR376 family members might be important factors leading to changes in autophagy levels in different tissues and cells.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

MIR376B belongs to a miRNA gene family encoded from a gene cluster region in the human chromosome 14q32, called the DLK1/GTL2 region.[15], [16], [17] Therefore, we wondered whether other miRNAs from the same region could play a role in autophagy regulation.	|	gene	|	regul	|	human

We showed that, miRNA response elements (MRE) in the 3?UTR region of these genes were direct targets of MIR376A.	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Although the nucleotide sequences of at least seven miRNA genes found in this region differed considerably, the seed sequences (around 8 nucleotide long miRNA core sequences responsible for target mRNA recognition) of MIR376A1, MIR376A2 and MIRB2 were identical to that of the MIR376B (Figure 1B and C).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Indeed, mRNA levels of both genes were decreased upon MIR376A overexpression (Figure 4C and D).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Therefore MIR376A controlled ATG4C and BECN1 levels by directly affecting specific MRE sequences in the 3?UTR regions of these autophagy genes.	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Altogether, our results underline the importance of MIR376A and MIR376B, and miRNAs in general, in the control of autophagic responses of cells and tissues.	|	gene	|	line	|	control

In fact, while BECN1 controls the production of PI3-P and regulates of autophagic vesicle nucleation sites, ATG4 is important for LC3 lipidation and in autophagic vesicle membrane elongation.	|	site	|	regul	|	control

Differential editing of MIR376 family members was reported in a number of tissues.[17] For example, while +44 site in the seed sequence of MIR376A was not edited in the mouse cortex, in the same tissue MIR376B was highly edited (around 50–60%) at this position.[17] Since editing in the seed region was shown to change target specificity of miRNAs including MIR376A*[17], [29] in addition to relative ratios of MIR376A and MIR376B, ratios between edited versus non-edited versions of MIR376 family members might be important factors leading to changes in autophagy levels in different tissues and cells.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Conclusions  Our findings underline the importance of miRNAs encoded by the DLK1/GTL2 gene cluster in stress-response control mechanisms, and introduce MIR376A as a new regulator of autophagy.	|	gene	|	regul	|	line	|	ec	|	control

Functional at a basal level for long-lived protein degradation and organelle turnover under normal conditions, autophagy is rapidly upregulated in response to both extracellular (e.g. nutrient starvation, hypoxia) and intracellular (e.g. accumulation of unfolded proteins, damaged organelles, pathogens) stress factors.[1] Concerted action of several protein complexes formed by at least 32 different autophagy (ATG) proteins result in the formation of double- or multi-membrane vesicles called autophagic vesicles or autophagosomes.[2] These vesicles enwrap cargo molecules and carry them to lysosomes for degradation, resulting in the recycling of their constituents for reuse by the cell.[3], [4]  Protein complexes playing a role in autophagosome formation are numerous.	|	regul	|	utr	|	protein	|	ec

Lipid conjugated LC3 is necessary for the elongation of autophagic membranes and completion of the vesicles.[7] Indeed, cells lacking one of the conjugation reaction components were shown to harbor autophagy defects.[8]  Recent studies introduced microRNAs (miRNAs) as novel regulators of autophagy.[9], [10], [11] miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs serving as negative regulators of gene expression.[12] By base pairing with sequences found mainly in the 3? untranslated region (3?UTR) of specific mRNAs, miRNAs lead to mRNA instability and/or translation inhibition resulting in a decrease in target gene expression.[13] A single miRNA may target tens to hundreds of mRNAs, hence may co-regulate and coordinate a number of cellular proteins and pathways at once.[14] So far, only a handful of miRNAs were shown to directly affect the autophagic activity.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

Among them, MIR376B was introduced as a new regulator of starvation and mTOR-inhibition-related autophagy.[10] MIR376B blocked autophagy by affecting the expression of two key autophagy proteins, namely ATG4C and BECN1.	|	express	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

MIR376B belongs to a miRNA gene family encoded from a gene cluster region in the human chromosome 14q32, called the DLK1/GTL2 region.[15], [16], [17] Therefore, we wondered whether other miRNAs from the same region could play a role in autophagy regulation.	|	gene	|	regul	|	human

Our findings underline the importance of miRNAs coded by the DLK1/GTL2 genomic region in physiological regulation and control of the autophagic activity.	|	regul	|	line	|	control

Therefore, similar to MIR376B, MIR376A could also regulate expression levels of two key proteins in the autophagy pathway.	|	express	|	regul	|	protein

MIR376A directly targeted ATG4C and BECN1 3? UTR sequences  To prove that negative regulation of the autophagy proteins by MIR376A was a result of a direct effect of the miRNA, reporter luciferase vectors containing predicted 3? UTR MRE sequences in ATG4C and BECN1 mRNAs were prepared.	|	target	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

Role of endogenous MIR376A in the control of starvation-induced autophagic activity  To further reveal the role of endogenous MIR376A in autophagy regulation, we transfected cells with control or MIR376A antagomirs, and analyzed conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and SQSTM1 degradation as markers of the autophagic activity.	|	regul	|	ec	|	control

In fact, while BECN1 controls the production of PI3-P and regulates of autophagic vesicle nucleation sites, ATG4 is important for LC3 lipidation and in autophagic vesicle membrane elongation.	|	site	|	regul	|	control

In line with the importance of these proteins in autophagy control, both proteins were reported to be regulated by diverse signals and pathways.	|	regul	|	protein	|	line	|	control

In fact, BECN1 was subject to regulation by transcriptional upregulation, protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation and ubiquitination.[19], [20], [21] ATG4 was also reported to be regulated in various ways including transcriptional upregulation and reactive oxygen species [22] Moreover, miRNAs other than MIR376 family were shown to target BECN1 or ATG4 as well.	|	target	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

According to Kawahara et.al (2007), miR-376 family members were transcribed as a long primary transcript.[17] Reports by Seitz et al. and Teferedegne et al. confirmed experimentally the presence of a common transcript including MIR376A and MIR376B.[16], [25] In line with these data, a recent study showed that the expression of MIR376A, MIR376B and MIR376C was regulated by a transcription factor called AIRE in a coordinated manner.[26] Although experimental confirmation is currently missing, our bioinformatics analyses revealed that predicted short promoter regions of these two miRNAs could be responsive to overlapping but different transcription factors, indicating that single miRNA transcripts could also co-exist (unpublished data by Ilknur Melis Durasi, Osman Ugur Sezerman and Devrim Gozuacik).	|	express	|	regul	|	line	|	ec

For example, regulation by DICER was reported to affect the levels of let-7.[27] Moreover, complexes Ago proteins were shown to determine the stability of various miRNAs.[28] Further studies are required to reveal the nature and molecular details of posttranscriptional events that are responsible for the differential regulation of MIR376A and MIR376B levels under stress-inducing conditions.	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

While MIR376B is highly expressed in the spleen and adrenal gland, MIR376A was reported to be abundant in the brain and uterus (Fig. S1).[30] A number of studies in the literature, showed the importance of MIR376A during development and differentiation-related events including erythroid differentiation [31], keratinocyte differentiation [32] and skeletal muscle development.[33] MIR376A was also shown to be upregulated during chemical and replicative senescence in human fibroblasts.[34]  Additionally, changes in MIR376 levels were observed under pathological conditions.	|	express	|	regul	|	human

While MIR376A was downregulated in esophageal cancer [35] and melanomas [36] and upregulated in salivary gland adenomas,[37] and pancreatic carcinomas,[38], [39] MIR376B was differentially expressed in uterine leiomyomas [40] and renal cell carcinomas.[41] Moreover, changes in MIR376A levels could be used as a marker to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, but MIR376B could serve as a breast cancer subtype marker.[42] Additionally, MIR376A and MIR376B were subjected to variable levels of editing in glioblastomas.[43]  Autophagy serves as a cellular defense mechanism against various pathogens including viruses.[44], [45] Not surprisingly, as a countermeasure, viruses evolved ways of modulating autophagy during productive and latent stages of the viral infection.[46] miRNAs of both viral and cellular origins were shown to affect cellular responses to viruses such as apoptosis, therefore, it is possible that autophagy-regulating miRNAs play a role in the battle between viruses and the host.	|	express	|	cancer	|	regul	|	ec

Autophagic cargo receptor protein p62/SQSTM1 is also carried by autophagosomes to lysosomes and degraded there during the process.[18] Indeed, starvation resulted in SQSTM1 degradation in cells transfected with the control miRNAs, and inhibition of the lysosomal enzymes blocked its degradation (Figure 2D).	|	protein	|	ec	|	control

Additionally, MIR376A overexpression led to a decrease in the levels of both ATG4C (Figure 4E) and BECN1 (Figure 4F) proteins.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Therefore, similar to MIR376B, MIR376A could also regulate expression levels of two key proteins in the autophagy pathway.	|	express	|	regul	|	protein

While control antagomirs (CNT-Ant) showed no significant effect, introduction of MIR376A-specific antagomirs (Ant-376A) into cells led to a significant increase in ATG4C mRNA (Figure 5A) and protein levels (Figure 5C).	|	protein	|	ec	|	control

Since ATG4C and BECN1 function at two different steps of autophagic vesicle formation, targeting of both of these key autophagy proteins at once by the MIR376 family of miRNAs allows a robust decrease in the autophagic activity.	|	target	|	protein	|	ec

Role of endogenous MIR376A in the control of starvation-induced autophagic activity  To further reveal the role of endogenous MIR376A in autophagy regulation, we transfected cells with control or MIR376A antagomirs, and analyzed conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and SQSTM1 degradation as markers of the autophagic activity.	|	regul	|	ec	|	control

Since ATG4C and BECN1 function at two different steps of autophagic vesicle formation, targeting of both of these key autophagy proteins at once by the MIR376 family of miRNAs allows a robust decrease in the autophagic activity.	|	target	|	protein	|	ec

In fact, BECN1 was subject to regulation by transcriptional upregulation, protein-protein interactions, phosphorylation and ubiquitination.[19], [20], [21] ATG4 was also reported to be regulated in various ways including transcriptional upregulation and reactive oxygen species [22] Moreover, miRNAs other than MIR376 family were shown to target BECN1 or ATG4 as well.	|	target	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

According to Kawahara et.al (2007), miR-376 family members were transcribed as a long primary transcript.[17] Reports by Seitz et al. and Teferedegne et al. confirmed experimentally the presence of a common transcript including MIR376A and MIR376B.[16], [25] In line with these data, a recent study showed that the expression of MIR376A, MIR376B and MIR376C was regulated by a transcription factor called AIRE in a coordinated manner.[26] Although experimental confirmation is currently missing, our bioinformatics analyses revealed that predicted short promoter regions of these two miRNAs could be responsive to overlapping but different transcription factors, indicating that single miRNA transcripts could also co-exist (unpublished data by Ilknur Melis Durasi, Osman Ugur Sezerman and Devrim Gozuacik).	|	express	|	regul	|	line	|	ec

For example, regulation by DICER was reported to affect the levels of let-7.[27] Moreover, complexes Ago proteins were shown to determine the stability of various miRNAs.[28] Further studies are required to reveal the nature and molecular details of posttranscriptional events that are responsible for the differential regulation of MIR376A and MIR376B levels under stress-inducing conditions.	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

Differential editing of MIR376 family members was reported in a number of tissues.[17] For example, while +44 site in the seed sequence of MIR376A was not edited in the mouse cortex, in the same tissue MIR376B was highly edited (around 50–60%) at this position.[17] Since editing in the seed region was shown to change target specificity of miRNAs including MIR376A*[17], [29] in addition to relative ratios of MIR376A and MIR376B, ratios between edited versus non-edited versions of MIR376 family members might be important factors leading to changes in autophagy levels in different tissues and cells.	|	target	|	site	|	ec

While MIR376A was downregulated in esophageal cancer [35] and melanomas [36] and upregulated in salivary gland adenomas,[37] and pancreatic carcinomas,[38], [39] MIR376B was differentially expressed in uterine leiomyomas [40] and renal cell carcinomas.[41] Moreover, changes in MIR376A levels could be used as a marker to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, but MIR376B could serve as a breast cancer subtype marker.[42] Additionally, MIR376A and MIR376B were subjected to variable levels of editing in glioblastomas.[43]  Autophagy serves as a cellular defense mechanism against various pathogens including viruses.[44], [45] Not surprisingly, as a countermeasure, viruses evolved ways of modulating autophagy during productive and latent stages of the viral infection.[46] miRNAs of both viral and cellular origins were shown to affect cellular responses to viruses such as apoptosis, therefore, it is possible that autophagy-regulating miRNAs play a role in the battle between viruses and the host.	|	express	|	cancer	|	regul	|	ec

In line with a possible role of MIR376 family in virus-host interactions, a miRNA profiling revealed differential expression of MIR376A and MIR376B in control versus HIV-1 positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells.[47] In another study, an interesting interplay between viral miRNAs and MIR376A was reported.[48] MREs for MIR376A in the 3? UTR of the MICB mRNA (a stress-induced ligand necessary for host cell recognition and destruction by natural killer cells) overlapped with the MRE of Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) miRNA, miR-K12-7.	|	express	|	line	|	ec	|	control

Indeed, KSHV was previously shown to downregulate autophagy, apoptosis and cell death using its viral FLIP and BCL-2 proteins that target autophagy-related proteins ATG3 and BECN1, respectively.	|	target	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

Our findings underline the importance of miRNAs coded by the DLK1/GTL2 genomic region in physiological regulation and control of the autophagic activity.	|	regul	|	line	|	control

Autophagic cargo receptor protein p62/SQSTM1 is also carried by autophagosomes to lysosomes and degraded there during the process.[18] Indeed, starvation resulted in SQSTM1 degradation in cells transfected with the control miRNAs, and inhibition of the lysosomal enzymes blocked its degradation (Figure 2D).	|	protein	|	ec	|	control

While control antagomirs (CNT-Ant) showed no significant effect, introduction of MIR376A-specific antagomirs (Ant-376A) into cells led to a significant increase in ATG4C mRNA (Figure 5A) and protein levels (Figure 5C).	|	protein	|	ec	|	control

Therefore MIR376A controlled ATG4C and BECN1 levels by directly affecting specific MRE sequences in the 3?UTR regions of these autophagy genes.	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Role of endogenous MIR376A in the control of starvation-induced autophagic activity  To further reveal the role of endogenous MIR376A in autophagy regulation, we transfected cells with control or MIR376A antagomirs, and analyzed conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and SQSTM1 degradation as markers of the autophagic activity.	|	regul	|	ec	|	control

In fact, while BECN1 controls the production of PI3-P and regulates of autophagic vesicle nucleation sites, ATG4 is important for LC3 lipidation and in autophagic vesicle membrane elongation.	|	site	|	regul	|	control

Recent studies have established a dual role for the transcription factor Pax6 as both an activator and repressor of gene expression in the eye, central nervous system, and pancreas.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

In this study, using wide-scale analysis of changes in gene expression following Pax6 deletion in the lens, we discover that Pax6 regulates the gene Trpm3 and its hosted microRNA, miR-204.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul

Pax6 may also enhance gene expression by recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes and alleviating heterochromatin repression [4], [7], [8].	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

We show that inhibition of gene expression by Pax6 is at least partly mediated through direct activation of miR-204.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Go to: Results Large-scale changes in the lens transcriptome as a result of Pax6 deletion  To identify new Pax6 genetic targets in the developing lens, an expression microarray was performed on embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) lenses from controls and somatic mutants of Pax6 (Pax6loxP/loxP;Mlr10-cre, [24]).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	control

This raised the possibility of Pax6's role in directly or indirectly repressing the expression of a large number of genes.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Considering the possibility that Pax6 regulates Trpm3 expression directly during eye development, we compared the spatio-temporal expression patterns of Pax6 protein and Trpm3 mRNA during eye morphogenesis and differentiation (Figure 1).	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

In contrast, from E10.5 onwards, Trpm3 mRNA was co-expressed with Pax6 protein in the lens and optic cup (OC) lineages.	|	express	|	protein	|	line

From that stage onwards, Trpm3 expression recapitulated the complex ocular pattern of Pax6 expression, suggesting that Pax6 regulates Trpm3 expression in the developing lens and OC derivatives.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

miR-204 binds the 3? UTR of Sox11 and down-regulates its expression  Since miR-204 is down-regulated in ocular tissues depleted in Pax6, we next examined which downstream genes might be regulated by miR-204 in the developing mouse eye.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	bind

Therefore, miR-204 binds the 3? UTR of Sox11 and down-regulates its expression.	|	express	|	regul	|	bind

Pax6 regulation of Trpm/miR-204 is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates  As miR-204 was previously shown to be expressed and to regulate eye morphogenesis in medaka fish [17], we hypothesized that Pax6 regulation of medaka miR-204 is evolutionarily conserved.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul

The ol-Trpm1 was expressed in the LP, neuroretina, ciliary marginal zone, ciliary body and presumed RPE (Figure 4C, 4F), suggesting that both ol-Trpm3 and ol-Trpm1 may have undergone a process of divergent gene functionalization, a common evolutionary process in teleost species [40].	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

miR-204 mediates Pax6 suppression of Sox11 and additional genes in the lens and in medaka embryos  To further evaluate the contribution of miR-204 to the phenotype observed following loss of Pax6, we tested the response of a subset of seven additional genes (Cpn8, Satb2, Hcn2, Nfia, Myo10, Fbn2, and Elavl3) that were both up-regulated in Pax6-negative lenses and contained putative miR-204 binding sites in their 3? UTR (Table 2) to over-expression of hsa-miR-204 mimic.	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

Most of these genes were examined in the human lens H36CE cell line, whereas Elavl3, a member of the Hu family of neuronal RNA binding proteins, was examined in mouse Neu-2a cells (Figure S8) because of its low expression levels in the lens cell line (data not shown).	|	express	|	gene	|	bind	|	human	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

Luciferase assay conducted on the Elavl3 3? UTR further supported direct regulation of Elavl3 by miR-204, and antibody labeling revealed expansion of Elavl3 expression to the posterior lens cells of Pax6loxP/loxP;Mrl10-Cre mutants (Figure S8, [43]).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Figure 5 Figure 5 miR-204 affects expression of multiple genes and mediates Pax6 suppression of gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

As the expression pattern and regulation of miR-204 seem to be conserved between fish and mammals ([17], Figure 4), we also expected conservation of miR-204 activity.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Injection of mouse Pax6 mRNA into medaka embryos resulted in reduced expression of these three genes compared with control embryos injected with EGFP mRNA (ol-Sox11 was reduced to 45±5.1%, ol-Myo10 was reduced to 43±6.3%, and ol-Fbn2 to 56.4±2.1% Figure 5C).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Collectively, and similar to mammals, the expression of ol-Sox11, ol-Fbn2 and ol-Myo10 is negatively regulated by Pax6 and ol-miR-204 in medaka fish.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Go to: Discussion In this paper we establish Pax6 as an indirect negative regulator of gene expression through miR-204.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

In future studies it would be of interest to distinguish the different expression pattern of Trpm1/3 paralog genes and the functional activity of their hosted miRNAs in the different lineages.	|	express	|	gene	|	line

Furthermore, as miR-204 is expressed in several epithelial tissues that originate from the neuroectoderm, including the ciliary body, iris and choroid plexus, it is possible that miR-204 plays a more general role in maintenance of a non-neuronal fate of various epithelia within the CNS.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

This regulatory loop may only be relevant at early stages of lens development, because in the mouse lens, Meis1 and Meis2 expression is lost before E12.5 [53], whereas Pax6 and miR-204 expression is maintained throughout development (Figure 1).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Pax6 regulation of neuronal SOX genes  A previous global analysis of gene expression revealed a significant number of neuron-specific genes that are up-regulated in Pax6-heterozygous lenses [31].	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

In cells that express miR-204, the regulation of Sox11 by Pax6 becomes inhibitory, contributing to loss of Sox11 expression from the lens fibers (Figure 3 and Figure 6).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

We therefore considered the possibility that Pax6 might negatively regulate Sox11 transcription directly, in addition to repressing expression through miR-204.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Immunofluorescence quantification of protein levels  For Sox11 repression by miR-204, Neuro-2a cells (ATCC) were grown on coverslips in 24-well plates for 24 h and then co-transfected with 500 ng of pCAG-GFP expression plasmid and either 500 ng of scrambled-miRVec or miR-204-miRVec expression plasmid containing the pre-miRNA of miR-204 [75].	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

Statistical analysis revealed significant over-representation of miR-204 target genes among the genes negatively regulated by Pax6 (hypergeometric test, P = 0.019), making them good candidates for miR-204-mediated repression in the developing lens.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

In contrast, when we used a mutated version of the site that had the highest probability of conserved targeting (based on TargetScan version 6.2, position 914–921 on the 3? UTR), luciferase levels were restored to control levels (96%, P = 0.20, Figure 3D arrow).	|	target	|	site	|	control

In addition, the novel miR-204 targets in lens development uncovered here include genes involved in cell motility Myo10 [48], cell matrix and regulation of the TGF? pathway Fbn2 [49], and genes that function in neuronal or glia cells Sox11 [37], Elavl3 [43], Cpne8 [50] and Nfia [51].	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

Furthermore, comparison of the protein sequences together with phylogenetic analysis of many known vertebrate Trpm1 and Trpm3 proteins (human, caw, mouse, rat, chicken, Xenopus, zebrafish, Table S6) using PHYLIP package tools [41] identified ol-Trpm1 as more closely related to the mammalian Trpm3 than to mammalian Trpm1 (Figure S6).	|	gene	|	human	|	protein

Utilizing phylogenetic footprinting in sequences from related species [42], we identified putative Pax6 cis-regulatory elements within the first 1.5 kb upstream of the ol-Trpm1 coding region (Figure 4E).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

miR-204 mediates Pax6 suppression of Sox11 and additional genes in the lens and in medaka embryos  To further evaluate the contribution of miR-204 to the phenotype observed following loss of Pax6, we tested the response of a subset of seven additional genes (Cpn8, Satb2, Hcn2, Nfia, Myo10, Fbn2, and Elavl3) that were both up-regulated in Pax6-negative lenses and contained putative miR-204 binding sites in their 3? UTR (Table 2) to over-expression of hsa-miR-204 mimic.	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

Most of these genes were examined in the human lens H36CE cell line, whereas Elavl3, a member of the Hu family of neuronal RNA binding proteins, was examined in mouse Neu-2a cells (Figure S8) because of its low expression levels in the lens cell line (data not shown).	|	express	|	gene	|	bind	|	human	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

From the eight genes that were tested, including Sox11, six were down-regulated in response to hsa-miR-204 mimic; the five reduced in H36CE cells were also significantly elevated following transfection with hsa-miR-204 inhibitor (Cpn8, Nfia, Myo10, Fbn2, Sox11; Figure 5A).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Figure 5 Figure 5 miR-204 affects expression of multiple genes and mediates Pax6 suppression of gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

ol-Meis2, ol-Sox11, ol-Fbn2 and ol-Myo10 transcripts were significantly reduced following treatment with hsa-miR-204 mimic, by 28±3.7%, 23±2.8%, 43±3,4% and 21±1% relative to the control, respectively (Figure 5B); these genes were up-regulated following treatment with the Mo-miR-204 by 26.5±4.9%, 38.5±7.8%, 21±4% and 29.4±1.1%, respectively, relative to the control (Figure 5B).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	control

Injection of mouse Pax6 mRNA into medaka embryos resulted in reduced expression of these three genes compared with control embryos injected with EGFP mRNA (ol-Sox11 was reduced to 45±5.1%, ol-Myo10 was reduced to 43±6.3%, and ol-Fbn2 to 56.4±2.1% Figure 5C).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

These findings reveal several novel targets of miR-204 in the lens and demonstrate how Pax6 direct control of miR-204 can simultaneously inhibit multiple genes, thus tightly regulating normal lens fate and physiology.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	control

Go to: Discussion In this paper we establish Pax6 as an indirect negative regulator of gene expression through miR-204.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

In future studies it would be of interest to distinguish the different expression pattern of Trpm1/3 paralog genes and the functional activity of their hosted miRNAs in the different lineages.	|	express	|	gene	|	line

In addition, the novel miR-204 targets in lens development uncovered here include genes involved in cell motility Myo10 [48], cell matrix and regulation of the TGF? pathway Fbn2 [49], and genes that function in neuronal or glia cells Sox11 [37], Elavl3 [43], Cpne8 [50] and Nfia [51].	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

The identification of multiple genes responding to miR-204, and the finding that some of these targets are conserved among vertebrates (Sox11, Fbn2, Myo10), suggest a major effect of miR-204 in regulating LE fate and cell behavior.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Furthermore, as miR-204 is expressed in several epithelial tissues that originate from the neuroectoderm, including the ciliary body, iris and choroid plexus, it is possible that miR-204 plays a more general role in maintenance of a non-neuronal fate of various epithelia within the CNS.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Pax6 regulation of neuronal SOX genes  A previous global analysis of gene expression revealed a significant number of neuron-specific genes that are up-regulated in Pax6-heterozygous lenses [31].	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Combinatorial interactions between miRNAs and TFs have been suggested based on in-silico strategies which identified a prevalent TF-miRNA feed-forward loop in which miRNA and TFs co-regulate target genes, as well as each other [65], [66].	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

Therefore, Pax6 regulation of Sox11 during retinogenesis is expected to be part of a larger regulatory network, and may be repressed by miR-204 in only a subset of RPCs.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Pax6, a regulator of multiple processes during eye development, is shown to execute part of its gene regulation through direct activation of miR-204.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Pax6 directly binds Trpm3 regulatory sequences in vitro and in vivo  To determine whether Pax6 regulation of the Trpm3/miR-204 gene is direct, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify the binding region, in conjunction with in-silico TF binding site searches, followed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to precisely locate Pax6 binding sites.	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

We tested four sequences (Trpm3.1–4) containing putative Pax6 binding sites using EMSA (prediction of target sites was performed as described in [30], EMSA described in [31], and the sequence similarities of Trpm3.1–Trpm3.4 to Pax6 binding matrices are presented in Table S2, Table S3).	|	target	|	site	|	bind

Since most miRNA target sites can be found in the 3? UTR segment of the target genes, we searched for putative miR-204 binding sites in the 3? UTRs of all mouse genes (TargetScan Mouse, www.targetscan.org).	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	bind

From the list of genes containing conserved putative binding sites for miR-204, 35 were found to be up-regulated in the Pax6 mutant lens with at least a 1.5-fold change (Table 2).	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

To determine whether Sox11 down-regulation is a result of direct binding, part of the wild-type 3? UTR of Sox11, containing the first two putative miR-204 binding sites, was cloned downstream of the luciferase gene and compared to a mutated version of the 3? UTR.	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

In contrast, when we used a mutated version of the site that had the highest probability of conserved targeting (based on TargetScan version 6.2, position 914–921 on the 3? UTR), luciferase levels were restored to control levels (96%, P = 0.20, Figure 3D arrow).	|	target	|	site	|	control

Several miRNA binding sites on the gene's 3? UTR usually exhibit additive effects ([38]).	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

This up-regulation of the lacZ reporter may be due to loss of miR-204 binding sites within the 3? UTR, which were replaced with the lacZ gene, or to persistence of ?-galactosidase protein in the slow-metabolizing lens fibers.	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	protein

Nevertheless, it is possible that binding sites, other than those tested here, play a role in the regulation of Sox11 by Pax6, and that Pax6 represses Sox11 in the presence of co-factors which are only available in the restricted developmental context of the embryonic lens in vivo.	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

Go to: Introduction Lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) such as Pax6 direct the development of multiple tissues through the regulation of gene networks that execute discrete developmental programs.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Pax6 is considered a “master regulator” of eye development as it specifies the multiple cell lineages that comprise the eye in vertebrate and invertebrate species [3].	|	regul	|	line	|	ec

Therefore, regulation of a miRNA gene by a tissue-specific TF can facilitate the down-regulation of batteries of genes.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

The present study was aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism of Pax6-dependent transcriptional repression through unbiased analysis of up-regulated genes in Pax6-mutant lenses.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

The four genes that were down-regulated in both lens and neuronal lineages are potential direct transcriptional targets of Pax6.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	line	|	ec

Considering the possibility that Pax6 regulates Trpm3 expression directly during eye development, we compared the spatio-temporal expression patterns of Pax6 protein and Trpm3 mRNA during eye morphogenesis and differentiation (Figure 1).	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

From that stage onwards, Trpm3 expression recapitulated the complex ocular pattern of Pax6 expression, suggesting that Pax6 regulates Trpm3 expression in the developing lens and OC derivatives.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Pax6 directly binds Trpm3 regulatory sequences in vitro and in vivo  To determine whether Pax6 regulation of the Trpm3/miR-204 gene is direct, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify the binding region, in conjunction with in-silico TF binding site searches, followed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to precisely locate Pax6 binding sites.	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

Therefore, we concluded that Pax6 directly binds Trpm3 regulatory sequences located downstream of the second promoter of Trpm3.	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

miR-204 binds the 3? UTR of Sox11 and down-regulates its expression  Since miR-204 is down-regulated in ocular tissues depleted in Pax6, we next examined which downstream genes might be regulated by miR-204 in the developing mouse eye.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	bind

From the list of genes containing conserved putative binding sites for miR-204, 35 were found to be up-regulated in the Pax6 mutant lens with at least a 1.5-fold change (Table 2).	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

Statistical analysis revealed significant over-representation of miR-204 target genes among the genes negatively regulated by Pax6 (hypergeometric test, P = 0.019), making them good candidates for miR-204-mediated repression in the developing lens.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

Luciferase assay conducted on the Elavl3 3? UTR further supported direct regulation of Elavl3 by miR-204, and antibody labeling revealed expansion of Elavl3 expression to the posterior lens cells of Pax6loxP/loxP;Mrl10-Cre mutants (Figure S8, [43]).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

As the expression pattern and regulation of miR-204 seem to be conserved between fish and mammals ([17], Figure 4), we also expected conservation of miR-204 activity.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

ol-Meis2, ol-Sox11, ol-Fbn2 and ol-Myo10 transcripts were significantly reduced following treatment with hsa-miR-204 mimic, by 28±3.7%, 23±2.8%, 43±3,4% and 21±1% relative to the control, respectively (Figure 5B); these genes were up-regulated following treatment with the Mo-miR-204 by 26.5±4.9%, 38.5±7.8%, 21±4% and 29.4±1.1%, respectively, relative to the control (Figure 5B).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	control

Go to: Introduction Lineage-specific transcription factors (TFs) such as Pax6 direct the development of multiple tissues through the regulation of gene networks that execute discrete developmental programs.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Pax6 is considered a “master regulator” of eye development as it specifies the multiple cell lineages that comprise the eye in vertebrate and invertebrate species [3].	|	regul	|	line	|	ec

Pax6 may also enhance gene expression by recruiting chromatin-remodeling enzymes and alleviating heterochromatin repression [4], [7], [8].	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Therefore, regulation of a miRNA gene by a tissue-specific TF can facilitate the down-regulation of batteries of genes.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

The present study was aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanism of Pax6-dependent transcriptional repression through unbiased analysis of up-regulated genes in Pax6-mutant lenses.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

We show that inhibition of gene expression by Pax6 is at least partly mediated through direct activation of miR-204.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

This raised the possibility of Pax6's role in directly or indirectly repressing the expression of a large number of genes.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

The four genes that were down-regulated in both lens and neuronal lineages are potential direct transcriptional targets of Pax6.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	line	|	ec

Considering the possibility that Pax6 regulates Trpm3 expression directly during eye development, we compared the spatio-temporal expression patterns of Pax6 protein and Trpm3 mRNA during eye morphogenesis and differentiation (Figure 1).	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

From that stage onwards, Trpm3 expression recapitulated the complex ocular pattern of Pax6 expression, suggesting that Pax6 regulates Trpm3 expression in the developing lens and OC derivatives.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Pax6 directly binds Trpm3 regulatory sequences in vitro and in vivo  To determine whether Pax6 regulation of the Trpm3/miR-204 gene is direct, we utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to identify the binding region, in conjunction with in-silico TF binding site searches, followed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to precisely locate Pax6 binding sites.	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

Therefore, we concluded that Pax6 directly binds Trpm3 regulatory sequences located downstream of the second promoter of Trpm3.	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

This was confirmed at the mRNA level in a human lens cell line (H36CE) and mouse Neu-2a transfected with a mimic miR-204 (see below and Figure S8).	|	human	|	line	|	ec

To determine whether Sox11 down-regulation is a result of direct binding, part of the wild-type 3? UTR of Sox11, containing the first two putative miR-204 binding sites, was cloned downstream of the luciferase gene and compared to a mutated version of the 3? UTR.	|	gene	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

The ol-Trpm1 was expressed in the LP, neuroretina, ciliary marginal zone, ciliary body and presumed RPE (Figure 4C, 4F), suggesting that both ol-Trpm3 and ol-Trpm1 may have undergone a process of divergent gene functionalization, a common evolutionary process in teleost species [40].	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Utilizing phylogenetic footprinting in sequences from related species [42], we identified putative Pax6 cis-regulatory elements within the first 1.5 kb upstream of the ol-Trpm1 coding region (Figure 4E).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Most of these genes were examined in the human lens H36CE cell line, whereas Elavl3, a member of the Hu family of neuronal RNA binding proteins, was examined in mouse Neu-2a cells (Figure S8) because of its low expression levels in the lens cell line (data not shown).	|	express	|	gene	|	bind	|	human	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

From the eight genes that were tested, including Sox11, six were down-regulated in response to hsa-miR-204 mimic; the five reduced in H36CE cells were also significantly elevated following transfection with hsa-miR-204 inhibitor (Cpn8, Nfia, Myo10, Fbn2, Sox11; Figure 5A).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Luciferase assay conducted on the Elavl3 3? UTR further supported direct regulation of Elavl3 by miR-204, and antibody labeling revealed expansion of Elavl3 expression to the posterior lens cells of Pax6loxP/loxP;Mrl10-Cre mutants (Figure S8, [43]).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Figure 5 Figure 5 miR-204 affects expression of multiple genes and mediates Pax6 suppression of gene expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

As the expression pattern and regulation of miR-204 seem to be conserved between fish and mammals ([17], Figure 4), we also expected conservation of miR-204 activity.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

ol-Meis2, ol-Sox11, ol-Fbn2 and ol-Myo10 transcripts were significantly reduced following treatment with hsa-miR-204 mimic, by 28±3.7%, 23±2.8%, 43±3,4% and 21±1% relative to the control, respectively (Figure 5B); these genes were up-regulated following treatment with the Mo-miR-204 by 26.5±4.9%, 38.5±7.8%, 21±4% and 29.4±1.1%, respectively, relative to the control (Figure 5B).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	control

Injection of mouse Pax6 mRNA into medaka embryos resulted in reduced expression of these three genes compared with control embryos injected with EGFP mRNA (ol-Sox11 was reduced to 45±5.1%, ol-Myo10 was reduced to 43±6.3%, and ol-Fbn2 to 56.4±2.1% Figure 5C).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Collectively, and similar to mammals, the expression of ol-Sox11, ol-Fbn2 and ol-Myo10 is negatively regulated by Pax6 and ol-miR-204 in medaka fish.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

These findings reveal several novel targets of miR-204 in the lens and demonstrate how Pax6 direct control of miR-204 can simultaneously inhibit multiple genes, thus tightly regulating normal lens fate and physiology.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	control

Go to: Discussion In this paper we establish Pax6 as an indirect negative regulator of gene expression through miR-204.	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

The identification of multiple genes responding to miR-204, and the finding that some of these targets are conserved among vertebrates (Sox11, Fbn2, Myo10), suggest a major effect of miR-204 in regulating LE fate and cell behavior.	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Furthermore, as miR-204 is expressed in several epithelial tissues that originate from the neuroectoderm, including the ciliary body, iris and choroid plexus, it is possible that miR-204 plays a more general role in maintenance of a non-neuronal fate of various epithelia within the CNS.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

This regulatory loop may only be relevant at early stages of lens development, because in the mouse lens, Meis1 and Meis2 expression is lost before E12.5 [53], whereas Pax6 and miR-204 expression is maintained throughout development (Figure 1).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Pax6 regulation of neuronal SOX genes  A previous global analysis of gene expression revealed a significant number of neuron-specific genes that are up-regulated in Pax6-heterozygous lenses [31].	|	express	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

In cells that express miR-204, the regulation of Sox11 by Pax6 becomes inhibitory, contributing to loss of Sox11 expression from the lens fibers (Figure 3 and Figure 6).	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

We therefore considered the possibility that Pax6 might negatively regulate Sox11 transcription directly, in addition to repressing expression through miR-204.	|	express	|	regul	|	ec

Therefore, Pax6 regulation of Sox11 during retinogenesis is expected to be part of a larger regulatory network, and may be repressed by miR-204 in only a subset of RPCs.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

In contrast, when we used a mutated version of the site that had the highest probability of conserved targeting (based on TargetScan version 6.2, position 914–921 on the 3? UTR), luciferase levels were restored to control levels (96%, P = 0.20, Figure 3D arrow).	|	target	|	site	|	control

Recently, it was reported that miR-145 inhibits cell proliferation of human lung adenocarcinoma by targeting EGFR, indicating that miR-145 is a tumor suppressor miRNA [55].	|	target	|	tumor	|	human	|	ec

The role of DCLK1 in the regulation of pluripotency in a cancer context is novel and may present an exciting new target for anti-cancer based therapy.	|	target	|	cancer	|	regul

For example, a single therapeutic miRNA may regulate hundreds of critical pathways that drive tumorigenesis; whereas, the introduction of a single DCLK1 targeted agent may induce multiple therapeutic miRNAs.	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

Furthermore, it was found that overexpression of miR-200 family significantly inhibits the NOTCH pathway in pancreatic cancer cells, which suggests the NOTCH pathway may be one of the miR-200 targets [60].	|	express	|	target	|	cancer

These data taken together suggest that DCLK1 plays a central regulatory role in pancreatic tumorigenesis, and the delivery of targeted siRNA based therapeutics that inhibit multiple pro-tumorigenic pathways under the control of DCLK1 may represent a simple straightforward approach to combat pancreatic cancer and perhaps other human solid tumor cancers.	|	target	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul	|	human	|	control

This combined with its central regulatory role in stem cell-like processes, pluripotency factor regulation, EMT and angiogenesis makes it an ideal and novel target for therapy in pancreatic cancer and perhaps other solid tumors.	|	target	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul

The dysregulation of these processes is believed to play key roles in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, and is contributory to PDAC being the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

The tumor suppressor miRNA miR-145 downregulates critical pluripotency factors and oncogenes and results in repressed metastatic potential in PDAC.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	oncogen

We conclude that DCLK1 plays a significant master regulatory role in pancreatic tumorigenesis through the regulation of multiple tumor suppressor miRNAs and their downstream pro-tumorigenic pathways.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

Another critical obstacle in combating solid tumor cancers in general is the heterogeneity of cell types within the tumor microenvironment [5] and the highly desmoplastic tumor niche [6].	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene

Consequently miRNAs have been demonstrated to act either as oncogenes (e.g., miR-155, miR-17?5p and miR-21) [15,16] or tumor suppressors (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16?1 and let-7) [17–20].	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

However, the precise regulatory features that tip the balance towards a cancer phenotype with respect to tumor suppressor versus oncogenic miRNA expression are poorly understood.	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

In cancer, miR-145 is downregulated and has been demonstrated to possess tumor suppressor properties.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

The loss of miR-145 (miR-143/145 cluster) is observed in KRAS mutated pancreatic cancers, and therapeutic restoration of these miRNAs abrogates tumorigenesis [29,30].	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene

Additionally, KRAS and RREB1 are targets of miR-143/145, demonstrating a feed-forward mechanism that potentiates RAS signaling-mediated PDAC tumor progression [29].	|	target	|	tumor	|	ec

It negatively regulates several tumor suppressor miRNAs and likely plays a key role in initiation and progression of solid tumor cancers [11,41].	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

In this report, following the knockdown of DCLK1 using nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA (NPsiDCLK1) in tumor xenografted mice, we observed a significant increase in: (A) miR-143/145 cluster, which resulted in downregulation of key pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and NANOG); (B) let-7a, which resulted in decreased pluripotency factor LIN28B; and (C) miR-200a, b and c, which resulted in downregulation of EMT and angiogenic factors.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	articl	|	ec

Knockdown of DCLK1 results in downregulation of pluripotency factors in pancreatic tumor xenografts via miR-145  It has been demonstrated that OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, LIN28, NANOG and KLF4 are required for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency and are upregulated in some aggressive cancers and in CSCs [23–26,28].	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

miR-145 is downregulated in various cancers and has been demonstrated to possess tumor suppressor and metastasis inhibitory properties [29,30].	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

With these data, we speculate that DCLK1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of miR-143/145 cluster and thereby downregulates KRAS and RREB1 in pancreatic tumor xenografts.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	ec

In pancreatic tumor xenografts treated with NPsiDCLK1, we observed a significant upregulation of let-7a (Figure 4A) and subsequent downregulation of its downstream target c-MYC (mRNA and protein) (Figure S1).	|	target	|	tumor	|	regul	|	protein

Based on real-time RT-PCR analysis of tumors treated with NPsiDCLK1, we observed a significant downregulation of LIN28B mRNA compared to NPsiSCR or control-treated tumors (Figure 4C).	|	tumor	|	regul	|	control

Furthermore, we wanted to investigate the effect of DCLK1 knockdown on expression of miR-200b and c in AsPC-1 tumor xenografts.	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

These data taken together indicate that knockdown of DCLK1 inhibits EMT and invasion by regulating miR-200 in human pancreatic tumor xenografts and cancer cells.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul	|	human

We observed a significant downregulation of VEGFR1 mRNA (Figure 6A), protein (Figure 6B and C – left panel) in tumors treated with NPsiDCLK1 compared to control and NPsiSCR treated-tumors.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	protein	|	control

We also observed downregulation of VEGFR2 mRNA (Figure 6E) and protein (Figure 6C – right panel) in pancreatic tumor xenografts treated with NPsiDCLK1.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	protein

In many tumors, there is either overexpression of so-called oncogenic miRNAs (e.g., miR-155, miR-17?5p and miR-21) [15,16] or downregulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16?1 and let-7) [17–20].	|	express	|	tumor	|	regul	|	oncogen

DCLK1 regulates EMT in human pancreatic cancer cells via a miR-200a dependent mechanism [11] and is also a regulator of let-7a in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells, which supports the concept that these miRNAs are relevant and novel targets in several solid tumor cancers [10,11,27,30,41].	|	target	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

In this report, we have demonstrated that in addition to regulating several tumor suppressor miRNAs and downstream oncogenic targets, DCLK1 inhibition results in upregulation of miRNAs that negatively regulate several key pluripotency and pro-angiogenic factors.	|	target	|	tumor	|	regul	|	oncogen

Reduced miR-143/145 expression is a common feature of many tumor types including colorectal carcinoma and PDAC [29,50,51].	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

VEGF and its receptors VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 have been demonstrated to play an important role in tumor vascular growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis [34].	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Though PDAC is not a grossly vascular tumor, they exhibit endothelial cell proliferation, one of the mechanisms that increase angiogenesis [38].	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Our data suggest that by down-regulating DCLK1 expression in pancreatic cancer, we are directly inducing or facilitating upregulation of several endogenous miRNAs within the tumors.	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul	|	ec

Using this candidate approach, we contend that endogenous upregulation of tumor suppressors may have an advantage over small molecule inhibitor-based approaches or even protein or miRNA replacement therapies.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

For example, a single therapeutic miRNA may regulate hundreds of critical pathways that drive tumorigenesis; whereas, the introduction of a single DCLK1 targeted agent may induce multiple therapeutic miRNAs.	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

All of these studies indicate that pluripotency, angiogenesis, EMT, NOTCH1, and cancer stemness are all involved in the complex interplay of cellular signaling, which are critical features of the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer that play an important role in cancer initiation, progression and metastasis.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene

The dysregulation of these processes is believed to play key roles in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, and is contributory to PDAC being the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

We conclude that DCLK1 plays a significant master regulatory role in pancreatic tumorigenesis through the regulation of multiple tumor suppressor miRNAs and their downstream pro-tumorigenic pathways.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

In cancer, miR-145 is downregulated and has been demonstrated to possess tumor suppressor properties.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

It negatively regulates several tumor suppressor miRNAs and likely plays a key role in initiation and progression of solid tumor cancers [11,41].	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

In addition, it regulates several key oncogenes (c-MYC, KRAS and NOTCH1) and EMT.	|	gene	|	regul	|	oncogen

In this report, following the knockdown of DCLK1 using nanoparticle-encapsulated siRNA (NPsiDCLK1) in tumor xenografted mice, we observed a significant increase in: (A) miR-143/145 cluster, which resulted in downregulation of key pluripotency markers (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and NANOG); (B) let-7a, which resulted in decreased pluripotency factor LIN28B; and (C) miR-200a, b and c, which resulted in downregulation of EMT and angiogenic factors.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	articl	|	ec

These data taken together suggest a central regulatory role of DCLK1 in pancreatic tumorigenesis.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

Knockdown of DCLK1 results in downregulation of pluripotency factors in pancreatic tumor xenografts via miR-145  It has been demonstrated that OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, LIN28, NANOG and KLF4 are required for ESC self-renewal and pluripotency and are upregulated in some aggressive cancers and in CSCs [23–26,28].	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

DCLK1 post-transcriptionally regulates miR-145 in pancreatic cancer  miR-145 has been shown to repress OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, thereby repressing pluripotency and controlling differentiation [21].	|	cancer	|	regul	|	control

miR-145 is downregulated in various cancers and has been demonstrated to possess tumor suppressor and metastasis inhibitory properties [29,30].	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul

These data suggest that knockdown of DCLK1 results in downregulation of miR-145 miRNA downstream targets in pancreatic cancer cells.	|	target	|	cancer	|	regul

Knockdown of DCLK1 resulted in increased expression of miR-143/145 cluster and downregulation of its downstream target KRAS (Figure 3D).	|	express	|	target	|	regul

With these data, we speculate that DCLK1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of miR-143/145 cluster and thereby downregulates KRAS and RREB1 in pancreatic tumor xenografts.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	ec

Overall, these data taken together demonstrate a potential regulatory role for DCLK1 in the expression of iPSC factors in pancreatic cancers via miR-145 miRNA.	|	express	|	cancer	|	regul

DCLK1 regulates let-7a and its downstream target LIN28B in pancreatic cancer  In pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells, we have previously demonstrated that DCLK1 negatively regulates miRNA let-7a.	|	target	|	cancer	|	regul	|	ec

In pancreatic tumor xenografts treated with NPsiDCLK1, we observed a significant upregulation of let-7a (Figure 4A) and subsequent downregulation of its downstream target c-MYC (mRNA and protein) (Figure S1).	|	target	|	tumor	|	regul	|	protein

Reports suggests that LIN28B, a pluripotency maintenance factor regulates miRNA let-7 and in turn let-7 regulates LIN28B (due to the presence of binding site in the 3’ UTR of LIN28B), which suggests a double negative feedback loop between LIN28 and let-7 [46,47].	|	site	|	regul	|	bind

Following the knockdown of DCLK1, we observed a significant downregulation of let-7-dependent luciferase activity (Figure 4B) indicating that NPsiDCLK1 regulates downstream targets of let-7 in pancreatic cancer cells.	|	target	|	cancer	|	regul

Based on real-time RT-PCR analysis of tumors treated with NPsiDCLK1, we observed a significant downregulation of LIN28B mRNA compared to NPsiSCR or control-treated tumors (Figure 4C).	|	tumor	|	regul	|	control

DCLK1 regulates miR-200 family genes and EMT in pancreatic cancer  EMT is a highly conserved process, characterized by the phenotypic conversion of epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells [7].	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul

Dysregulation of miRNAs are quite common in many human cancers including PDAC.	|	cancer	|	regul	|	human

In many tumors, there is either overexpression of so-called oncogenic miRNAs (e.g., miR-155, miR-17?5p and miR-21) [15,16] or downregulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16?1 and let-7) [17–20].	|	express	|	tumor	|	regul	|	oncogen

DCLK1 regulates EMT in human pancreatic cancer cells via a miR-200a dependent mechanism [11] and is also a regulator of let-7a in pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells, which supports the concept that these miRNAs are relevant and novel targets in several solid tumor cancers [10,11,27,30,41].	|	target	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

In this report, we have demonstrated that in addition to regulating several tumor suppressor miRNAs and downstream oncogenic targets, DCLK1 inhibition results in upregulation of miRNAs that negatively regulate several key pluripotency and pro-angiogenic factors.	|	target	|	tumor	|	regul	|	oncogen

The miRNA restitution was confirmed in treated xenografts by significant upregulation of the corresponding miRNA and significant decreases in specific miRNA targets (KRAS2 and RREB1 for miR-143/145).	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

Our data suggest that by down-regulating DCLK1 expression in pancreatic cancer, we are directly inducing or facilitating upregulation of several endogenous miRNAs within the tumors.	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	regul	|	ec

The role of DCLK1 in the regulation of pluripotency in a cancer context is novel and may present an exciting new target for anti-cancer based therapy.	|	target	|	cancer	|	regul

Using this candidate approach, we contend that endogenous upregulation of tumor suppressors may have an advantage over small molecule inhibitor-based approaches or even protein or miRNA replacement therapies.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	protein	|	ec

For example, a single therapeutic miRNA may regulate hundreds of critical pathways that drive tumorigenesis; whereas, the introduction of a single DCLK1 targeted agent may induce multiple therapeutic miRNAs.	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

The studies presented clearly implicate DCLK1 in the regulation of miR-143/145, miR-200, EMT, pluripotency, angiogenesis, NOTCH1, and cancer stemness.	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul

These data taken together suggest that DCLK1 plays a central regulatory role in pancreatic tumorigenesis, and the delivery of targeted siRNA based therapeutics that inhibit multiple pro-tumorigenic pathways under the control of DCLK1 may represent a simple straightforward approach to combat pancreatic cancer and perhaps other human solid tumor cancers.	|	target	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul	|	human	|	control

In many tumors, there is either overexpression of so-called oncogenic miRNAs (e.g., miR-155, miR-17?5p and miR-21) [15,16] or downregulation of tumor suppressor miRNAs (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16?1 and let-7) [17–20].	|	express	|	tumor	|	regul	|	oncogen

In this report, we have demonstrated that in addition to regulating several tumor suppressor miRNAs and downstream oncogenic targets, DCLK1 inhibition results in upregulation of miRNAs that negatively regulate several key pluripotency and pro-angiogenic factors.	|	target	|	tumor	|	regul	|	oncogen

Inhibition of multiple oncogenic pathways following the knockdown of DCLK1 was also observed in BxPC-3, human pancreatic cancer cell line (Figures S3 and S4).	|	cancer	|	human	|	line	|	oncogen

DCLK1 post-transcriptionally regulates miR-145 in pancreatic cancer  miR-145 has been shown to repress OCT4, SOX2, and KLF4, thereby repressing pluripotency and controlling differentiation [21].	|	cancer	|	regul	|	control

AsPC-1 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding firefly luciferase gene under the control of 3’ UTR containing binding site for let-7.	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

Based on real-time RT-PCR analysis of tumors treated with NPsiDCLK1, we observed a significant downregulation of LIN28B mRNA compared to NPsiSCR or control-treated tumors (Figure 4C).	|	tumor	|	regul	|	control

We observed a significant downregulation of VEGFR1 mRNA (Figure 6A), protein (Figure 6B and C – left panel) in tumors treated with NPsiDCLK1 compared to control and NPsiSCR treated-tumors.	|	tumor	|	regul	|	protein	|	control

These data taken together suggest that DCLK1 plays a central regulatory role in pancreatic tumorigenesis, and the delivery of targeted siRNA based therapeutics that inhibit multiple pro-tumorigenic pathways under the control of DCLK1 may represent a simple straightforward approach to combat pancreatic cancer and perhaps other human solid tumor cancers.	|	target	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul	|	human	|	control

We identify a microRNA exemplifying these attributes, miR-31, whose expression correlates inversely with metastasis in human breast cancer patients.	|	express	|	cancer	|	human

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of pleiotropically acting small RNAs that suppress gene expression post-transcriptionally via sequence-specific interactions with the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of cognate mRNA targets (Bartel, 2009).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

More than 50% of miRNA-encoding loci reside in chromosomal regions altered during tumorigenesis (Calin et al., 2004), and expression profiling reveals characteristic miRNA signatures for many tumor types – including breast neoplasias – that predict disease status and clinical outcome (Calin and Croce, 2006).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

Go to: RESULTS miR-31 Expression is Specifically Attenuated in Metastatic Breast Cancer Cell Lines  To identify miRNAs that might regulate breast cancer metastasis, we selected 10 cancer-associated miRNAs for further characterization due to their concordant identification among expression profiling studies of clinical breast tumors (Iorio et al., 2005; Volinia et al., 2006), global analysis of miRNA copy-number variation in human breast carcinomas (Zhang et al., 2006), and localization of miRNA loci to cancer-relevant sites of chromosomal aberration (Calin et al., 2004) (Table S1).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	site	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

Figure 1 Figure 1 miR-31 Levels Correlate Inversely With Metastatic Ability in Breast Cell Lines Relative to its expression in normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, miR-31 levels in sub-lines derived from a single murine mammary tumor reflected their capacities to metastasize: miR-31 was reduced by two-fold in metastatic D2.1 and D2A1 cells, but not in non-aggressive D2.OR cells (Figure 1B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

miR-31 levels were also inversely proportional to metastatic ability in four mouse mammary carcinoma sub-lines derived from a single spontaneously arising tumor: while miR-31 levels in non-aggressive 67NR cells were similar to those in NMuMG, miR-31 expression was progressively diminished upon acquisition of the capacity to invade locally (168FARN), to form micrometastases (4TO7), and to yield macroscopic metastases (4T1) (Figure 1B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line

miR-31 expression was heterogeneous in 4T1 cell primary mammary tumors; of note, the proportion of cells expressing miR-31 was 10-fold reduced in lung metastases relative to the fraction of miR-31-positive cells in the primary tumors from which they were derived (Figure 1C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

Thus, we stably expressed miR-31 in metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (“231 cells”).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human

These effects were specifically attributable to the biological activities of miR-31, as equivalent overexpression of a control miRNA, miR-145, failed to influence invasion or motility (Figure 2A and data not shown).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

The consequences of miR-31 expression were not unique to 231 cells: miR-31 reduced invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance, yet did not affect proliferation, in aggressive SUM-159 human breast cancer cells (Figure S2).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

Thus, 231 cells expressing miR-31 were injected into the orthotopic site – the mammary fat pad – of mice.	|	express	|	site	|	ec

Despite their ability to generate larger primary tumors, 231 cells expressing miR-31 were strikingly impaired in their capacity to seed lung metastases.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

As before, when injected orthotopically, miR-31-expressing cells formed large, well-encapsulated primary tumors and also reduced lung metastasis by five-fold (Figures S4B-S4D).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

Orthotopic injection of SUM-159 cells expressing miR-31 further corroborated our earlier findings: miR-31 enhanced primary tumor growth, yet miR-31-expressing tumors were more well-confined than control tumors (Figure S5).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

These observations indicated that the ability of miR-31-expressing cells to form larger, less invasive primary tumors, as well as to seed fewer metastases, is a specific consequence of the biological activities of miR-31.	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

This difference was not a consequence of an inability of miR-31-expressing cells to become lodged initially in the lung microvasculature, as equal numbers of miR-31-expressing and control cells were detected in the lungs 10 minutes and two hours post-injection (Figures 2G and S6A).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Three months after tail vein injection, miR-31-expressing 231 cells generated 40-fold fewer lung metastases than did controls (Figure 2G).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

We also observed a dramatic effect on the size of eventually formed lesions: after three months, miR-31-expressing cells generated only small micrometastases while control cells formed macroscopic metastases; this occurred despite the fact that miR-31-expressing and control cells established comparably sized micrometastases one month post-injection (Figures 2G and S6B).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

The latter are expression constructs that carry miRNA recognition motifs in their 3’ UTR that bind and thus titer miRNAs (Ebert et al., 2007).	|	express	|	bind	|	ec

When stably expressed in immortalized HMECs or tumorigenic but non-metastatic SUM-149 human breast cancer cells, the miR-31 sponge elicited increased invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance without affecting proliferation (Figure S9 and data not shown).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

Primary tumors derived from miR-31 sponge-expressing cells were poorly encapsulated and locally invasive, while control MCF7-Ras tumors appeared well-confined and non-invasive (Figures 3D and 3E).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

Strikingly, miR-31 sponge-expressing MCF7-Ras cells metastasized to the lungs in significant numbers, while control tumor-bearing host lungs were largely devoid of tumor cells; cells with impaired miR-31 activity formed 10-fold more lesions than did controls (Figure 3F).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

Within one day, miR-31 inhibition enhanced cell number in the lungs by six-fold; similarly, at later times after injection, miR-31 sponge-expressing cells were 10-fold more prevalent in the lungs than were controls (Figure 3G).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

The differing metastatic abilities of control and miR-31 sponge-expressing cells did not arise due to failure of control cells to become lodged initially in the lung vasculature, as equal numbers of cells from each cohort were present 10 minutes after injection (Figures 3G and S11).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Suppression of miR-31 also affected lesion size four months after tail vein injection: whereas control cells formed only small micrometastases, miR-31 sponge-expressing cells produced macroscopic metastases (Figure 3G).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Figure 4 Figure 4 miR-31 Directly Regulates a Cohort of Pro-Metastatic Genes Endogenous Fzd3, ITGA5, MMP16, RDX, and RhoA protein levels were assayed in miR-31-expressing 231 cells.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

These data indicated that miR-31 directly regulates endogenous Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX and RhoA expression in human breast cancer cells.	|	express	|	cancer	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

We determined if concomitant repression of Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX, and RhoA correlated with disease progression in clinical breast cancers by examining expression profiling data from 295 primary breast tumors (Table S4) (van de Vijver et al., 2002).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer

To do so, we constructed a miR-31 target signature based on coordinate differential expression of these six genes.	|	express	|	target	|	gene

Within this cohort, high expression of the miR-31 target signature was associated with metastasis, as well as poor survival, relative to signature-negative tumors; five-year survival among patients negative for the target signature was 90%, while >35% of target signature-positive patients succumbed to their disease over this interval (Figures 5A and 5B).	|	express	|	target	|	tumor

We evaluated if re-expression of any of the six targets rescued miR-31’s effects on anoikis.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

Thus, we stably re-expressed miRNA-resistant RhoA in 231 cells that already had been infected with either miR-31 or control vector (Figures S14A and S14B).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

To ascertain if restored RhoA levels reversed in vivo metastasis phenotypes ascribable to miR-31, we orthotopically injected mice with 231 cells expressing combinations of miR-31, RhoA, and control vectors.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

In consonance with our earlier findings, control 231 primary tumors were locally invasive, while miR-31-expressing tumors were non-invasive (Figures 6B and 6C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

In control 231 cells, ectopic RhoA failed to exacerbate the extent of local invasion; in contrast, RhoA abolished the previously encapsulated appearance of miR-31-expressing tumors and enabled invasion into surrounding normal tissue (Figures 6B and 6C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

Figure 6 Figure 6 Re-Expression of RhoA Partially Reverses miR-31-Imposed Metastasis Defects in vivo Re-expression of RhoA restored lung metastasis in miR-31-expressing 231 cells to 75% of control cell levels, while RhoA failed to enhance metastasis in control 231 cells (Figure 6D).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

While expression of miR-31 and/or RhoA failed to affect the initial lodging of tumor cells in the lung vasculature, the number of cells that persisted in the lungs differed within one day of injection (Figures 6E and S15).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

While expression of RhoA in control 231 cells failed to enhance metastasis, RhoA restored the number of lung metastases to 60% of control cell levels in miR-31-expressing cells; however, RhoA did not facilitate the formation of macroscopic metastases in cells with ectopic miR-31 (Figure 6E).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

miR-31 Expression Correlates Inversely With Metastasis in Human Breast Tumors  Because established cell lines and xenograft studies cannot fully recapitulate clinical malignancy, we extended our analyses by assaying miR-31 expression in specimens from 56 human breast cancer patients (Table S5; Median follow-up = 59 months).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	line	|	ec

When these 56 tumors were stratified based on clinical progression, we found that miR-31 expression was diminished in primary tumors that subsequently metastasized, when compared to normal breast tissue and primary tumors that did not recur; moreover, low miR-31 levels correlated strongly with reduced distant disease-free survival relative to tumors with high miR-31 (Figures 7A and 7B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	free	|	ec

We next assessed the heterogeneity of miR-31 expression in human primary breast tumors, as well as distant metastases arising in the same patients.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human

miR-31 was expressed in 65% of the cells in these primary tumors; however, miR-31 was detected in only 12–30% of cells in patient-matched distant metastases (Figure 7C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

These data raise the possibility that selective pressures operating over the course of breast cancer progression diminish the representation of miR-31-expressing cells within the population of successfully metastasizing cells.	|	express	|	cancer	|	ec

Finally, we asked if expression of ITGA5, RDX, and RhoA was also heterogeneous in primary human breast tumors.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human

RDX and RhoA were expressed in 60–75% of cells in the primary tumors examined, while ITGA5 was detected in >80% of cells (Figure 7D).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

Distant metastases were more homogeneous for the expression of RDX and RhoA than the primary tumors from which they were derived, as >90% of cells in the metastases expressed RDX and RhoA (Figure 7D).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

Re-expression of several individual miR-31 targets largely reversed miR-31-imposed defects in vitro.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

This may indicate that certain miR-31 effectors activate one another; however, ectopic ITGA5, RDX, or RhoA did not induce the expression of other miR-31 targets (data not shown).	|	express	|	target	|	ec

Tumors were considered miR-31-positive or -negative if the normalized expression of miR-31 resided in the top or bottom 30% of tumors in this cohort, respectively.	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

More than 50% of miRNA-encoding loci reside in chromosomal regions altered during tumorigenesis (Calin et al., 2004), and expression profiling reveals characteristic miRNA signatures for many tumor types – including breast neoplasias – that predict disease status and clinical outcome (Calin and Croce, 2006).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

In addition, miRNAs have been identified that function as classical oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (Ventura and Jacks, 2009), as well as a limited number that act at late stages of tumor progression (Ma et al., 2007; Tavazoie et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2008; Asangani et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2008; Lujambio et al., 2008).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

The pleiotropic nature of gene regulation exhibited by miRNAs led us to hypothesize that certain miRNAs might be endowed with a capacity to function as crucial modulators of tumor metastasis.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

Go to: RESULTS miR-31 Expression is Specifically Attenuated in Metastatic Breast Cancer Cell Lines  To identify miRNAs that might regulate breast cancer metastasis, we selected 10 cancer-associated miRNAs for further characterization due to their concordant identification among expression profiling studies of clinical breast tumors (Iorio et al., 2005; Volinia et al., 2006), global analysis of miRNA copy-number variation in human breast carcinomas (Zhang et al., 2006), and localization of miRNA loci to cancer-relevant sites of chromosomal aberration (Calin et al., 2004) (Table S1).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	site	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

Expression of the 10 candidate miRNAs was assayed in 15 human and mouse mammary cell lines, which included normal epithelial cells, tumorigenic but non-metastatic cells, and metastatic tumor cells (Table S2).	|	tumor	|	human	|	line

Figure 1 Figure 1 miR-31 Levels Correlate Inversely With Metastatic Ability in Breast Cell Lines Relative to its expression in normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, miR-31 levels in sub-lines derived from a single murine mammary tumor reflected their capacities to metastasize: miR-31 was reduced by two-fold in metastatic D2.1 and D2A1 cells, but not in non-aggressive D2.OR cells (Figure 1B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

miR-31 levels were also inversely proportional to metastatic ability in four mouse mammary carcinoma sub-lines derived from a single spontaneously arising tumor: while miR-31 levels in non-aggressive 67NR cells were similar to those in NMuMG, miR-31 expression was progressively diminished upon acquisition of the capacity to invade locally (168FARN), to form micrometastases (4TO7), and to yield macroscopic metastases (4T1) (Figure 1B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line

miR-31 expression was heterogeneous in 4T1 cell primary mammary tumors; of note, the proportion of cells expressing miR-31 was 10-fold reduced in lung metastases relative to the fraction of miR-31-positive cells in the primary tumors from which they were derived (Figure 1C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

As before, when injected orthotopically, miR-31-expressing cells formed large, well-encapsulated primary tumors and also reduced lung metastasis by five-fold (Figures S4B-S4D).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

Orthotopic injection of SUM-159 cells expressing miR-31 further corroborated our earlier findings: miR-31 enhanced primary tumor growth, yet miR-31-expressing tumors were more well-confined than control tumors (Figure S5).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

These observations indicated that the ability of miR-31-expressing cells to form larger, less invasive primary tumors, as well as to seed fewer metastases, is a specific consequence of the biological activities of miR-31.	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

When stably expressed in immortalized HMECs or tumorigenic but non-metastatic SUM-149 human breast cancer cells, the miR-31 sponge elicited increased invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance without affecting proliferation (Figure S9 and data not shown).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

Primary tumors derived from miR-31 sponge-expressing cells were poorly encapsulated and locally invasive, while control MCF7-Ras tumors appeared well-confined and non-invasive (Figures 3D and 3E).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

Strikingly, miR-31 sponge-expressing MCF7-Ras cells metastasized to the lungs in significant numbers, while control tumor-bearing host lungs were largely devoid of tumor cells; cells with impaired miR-31 activity formed 10-fold more lesions than did controls (Figure 3F).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

RhoA initially augmented primary tumor growth in the presence of ectopic miR-31, but failed to do so in control 231 cells (Figure 6A).	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

In consonance with our earlier findings, control 231 primary tumors were locally invasive, while miR-31-expressing tumors were non-invasive (Figures 6B and 6C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

Distant metastases were more homogeneous for the expression of RDX and RhoA than the primary tumors from which they were derived, as >90% of cells in the metastases expressed RDX and RhoA (Figure 7D).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

Moreover, miR-31 levels correlate inversely with metastatic recurrence in a cohort of human breast tumors, a preliminary association that appears to persist independent of both tumor grade and subtype.	|	tumor	|	human	|	ec

Given the capacity of miR-31 to enhance primary tumor growth, an oncogenic role for this miRNA (mechanistically independent of its metastasis-suppressive functions) cannot be formally excluded.	|	tumor	|	ec	|	oncogen

Such duality of action is not unprecedented (Massagué, 2008), and is consistent with notions that metastasis- and tumorigenesis-enabling attributes can be biologically distinct and acquired via independent selective pressures during malignant progression.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

The levels of several functionally relevant effectors of miR-31 correlate with disease progression in human tumors.	|	tumor	|	human	|	ec

For example, cell lines accumulate genetic changes in culture, while xenografts fail to recapitulate species-specific interactions between tumor cells and their stroma.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

However, the consistency of our results upon use of multiple independent cell lines (including a single-cell-derived population), the convergence of our gain- and loss-of-function findings, and our correlative studies in human breast cancer patients and murine mammary tumor cell lines argue against major confounding influences stemming from our experimental models.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human	|	line

Go to: RESULTS miR-31 Expression is Specifically Attenuated in Metastatic Breast Cancer Cell Lines  To identify miRNAs that might regulate breast cancer metastasis, we selected 10 cancer-associated miRNAs for further characterization due to their concordant identification among expression profiling studies of clinical breast tumors (Iorio et al., 2005; Volinia et al., 2006), global analysis of miRNA copy-number variation in human breast carcinomas (Zhang et al., 2006), and localization of miRNA loci to cancer-relevant sites of chromosomal aberration (Calin et al., 2004) (Table S1).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	site	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

The levels of a single miRNA, miR-31, were specifically attenuated in aggressive human breast cancer cells when compared to primary normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs).	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

Thus, we stably expressed miR-31 in metastatic MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells (“231 cells”).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human

The consequences of miR-31 expression were not unique to 231 cells: miR-31 reduced invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance, yet did not affect proliferation, in aggressive SUM-159 human breast cancer cells (Figure S2).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

When stably expressed in immortalized HMECs or tumorigenic but non-metastatic SUM-149 human breast cancer cells, the miR-31 sponge elicited increased invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance without affecting proliferation (Figure S9 and data not shown).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

These data indicated that miR-31 directly regulates endogenous Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX and RhoA expression in human breast cancer cells.	|	express	|	cancer	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

We determined if concomitant repression of Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX, and RhoA correlated with disease progression in clinical breast cancers by examining expression profiling data from 295 primary breast tumors (Table S4) (van de Vijver et al., 2002).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer

miR-31 Expression Correlates Inversely With Metastasis in Human Breast Tumors  Because established cell lines and xenograft studies cannot fully recapitulate clinical malignancy, we extended our analyses by assaying miR-31 expression in specimens from 56 human breast cancer patients (Table S5; Median follow-up = 59 months).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	line	|	ec

These data raise the possibility that selective pressures operating over the course of breast cancer progression diminish the representation of miR-31-expressing cells within the population of successfully metastasizing cells.	|	express	|	cancer	|	ec

Go to: SUMMARY MicroRNAs are well-suited to regulate tumor metastasis due to their capacity to coordinately repress numerous target genes, thereby potentially enabling their intervention at multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade.	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of pleiotropically acting small RNAs that suppress gene expression post-transcriptionally via sequence-specific interactions with the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of cognate mRNA targets (Bartel, 2009).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

In mammalian cells, miRNAs effect gene silencing via both translational inhibition and mRNA degradation; an individual miRNA is capable of regulating dozens of distinct mRNAs, and together the >650 human miRNAs are believed to modulate greater than one-third of the mRNA species encoded in the genome (Bartel, 2009).	|	gene	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

More than 50% of miRNA-encoding loci reside in chromosomal regions altered during tumorigenesis (Calin et al., 2004), and expression profiling reveals characteristic miRNA signatures for many tumor types – including breast neoplasias – that predict disease status and clinical outcome (Calin and Croce, 2006).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

In addition, miRNAs have been identified that function as classical oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (Ventura and Jacks, 2009), as well as a limited number that act at late stages of tumor progression (Ma et al., 2007; Tavazoie et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2008; Asangani et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2008; Lujambio et al., 2008).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

The pleiotropic nature of gene regulation exhibited by miRNAs led us to hypothesize that certain miRNAs might be endowed with a capacity to function as crucial modulators of tumor metastasis.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul

miR-31 expression was heterogeneous in 4T1 cell primary mammary tumors; of note, the proportion of cells expressing miR-31 was 10-fold reduced in lung metastases relative to the fraction of miR-31-positive cells in the primary tumors from which they were derived (Figure 1C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

Despite their ability to generate larger primary tumors, 231 cells expressing miR-31 were strikingly impaired in their capacity to seed lung metastases.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

Three months after tail vein injection, miR-31-expressing 231 cells generated 40-fold fewer lung metastases than did controls (Figure 2G).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

We also observed a dramatic effect on the size of eventually formed lesions: after three months, miR-31-expressing cells generated only small micrometastases while control cells formed macroscopic metastases; this occurred despite the fact that miR-31-expressing and control cells established comparably sized micrometastases one month post-injection (Figures 2G and S6B).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

miR-31 Directly Regulates a Cohort of Pro-Metastatic Genes  miR-31’s ability to impede multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade might derive from its ability to pleiotropically regulate genes involved in diverse aspects of metastatic dissemination.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000) revealed that these targets included a disproportionately large number of genes encoding proteins with roles in motility-related processes, such as cell adhesion, cytoskeletal remodeling, and cell polarity (data not shown).	|	target	|	gene	|	protein

To do so, we constructed a miR-31 target signature based on coordinate differential expression of these six genes.	|	express	|	target	|	gene

We next assessed the heterogeneity of miR-31 expression in human primary breast tumors, as well as distant metastases arising in the same patients.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human

Finally, we asked if expression of ITGA5, RDX, and RhoA was also heterogeneous in primary human breast tumors.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human

Distant metastases were more homogeneous for the expression of RDX and RhoA than the primary tumors from which they were derived, as >90% of cells in the metastases expressed RDX and RhoA (Figure 7D).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

Such duality of action is not unprecedented (Massagué, 2008), and is consistent with notions that metastasis- and tumorigenesis-enabling attributes can be biologically distinct and acquired via independent selective pressures during malignant progression.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

For example, cell lines accumulate genetic changes in culture, while xenografts fail to recapitulate species-specific interactions between tumor cells and their stroma.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Our data suggest that the loss of a single gene product can facilitate the completion of multiple distinct steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade; this pleiotropic action may help to explain how tumor cells can accumulate enough genetic and epigenetic aberrations over the course of a human lifespan to overcome the numerous barriers that normally operate to prevent metastasis.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human

Expression of the 10 candidate miRNAs was assayed in 15 human and mouse mammary cell lines, which included normal epithelial cells, tumorigenic but non-metastatic cells, and metastatic tumor cells (Table S2).	|	tumor	|	human	|	line

Figure 1 Figure 1 miR-31 Levels Correlate Inversely With Metastatic Ability in Breast Cell Lines Relative to its expression in normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, miR-31 levels in sub-lines derived from a single murine mammary tumor reflected their capacities to metastasize: miR-31 was reduced by two-fold in metastatic D2.1 and D2A1 cells, but not in non-aggressive D2.OR cells (Figure 1B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

miR-31 levels were also inversely proportional to metastatic ability in four mouse mammary carcinoma sub-lines derived from a single spontaneously arising tumor: while miR-31 levels in non-aggressive 67NR cells were similar to those in NMuMG, miR-31 expression was progressively diminished upon acquisition of the capacity to invade locally (168FARN), to form micrometastases (4TO7), and to yield macroscopic metastases (4T1) (Figure 1B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line

miR-31 Expression Correlates Inversely With Metastasis in Human Breast Tumors  Because established cell lines and xenograft studies cannot fully recapitulate clinical malignancy, we extended our analyses by assaying miR-31 expression in specimens from 56 human breast cancer patients (Table S5; Median follow-up = 59 months).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	line	|	ec

For example, cell lines accumulate genetic changes in culture, while xenografts fail to recapitulate species-specific interactions between tumor cells and their stroma.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

However, the consistency of our results upon use of multiple independent cell lines (including a single-cell-derived population), the convergence of our gain- and loss-of-function findings, and our correlative studies in human breast cancer patients and murine mammary tumor cell lines argue against major confounding influences stemming from our experimental models.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human	|	line

These phenotypes do not involve confounding influences on primary tumor development and are specifically attributable to miR-31-mediated inhibition of several steps of metastasis, including local invasion, extravasation or initial survival at a distant site, and metastatic colonization.	|	tumor	|	site	|	ec

Go to: INTRODUCTION Metastases account for 90% of human cancer deaths (Gupta and Massagué, 2006), yet our understanding of the molecular circuitry that governs metastatic dissemination remains fragmentary.	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute an evolutionarily conserved class of pleiotropically acting small RNAs that suppress gene expression post-transcriptionally via sequence-specific interactions with the 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of cognate mRNA targets (Bartel, 2009).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

In mammalian cells, miRNAs effect gene silencing via both translational inhibition and mRNA degradation; an individual miRNA is capable of regulating dozens of distinct mRNAs, and together the >650 human miRNAs are believed to modulate greater than one-third of the mRNA species encoded in the genome (Bartel, 2009).	|	gene	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

Go to: RESULTS miR-31 Expression is Specifically Attenuated in Metastatic Breast Cancer Cell Lines  To identify miRNAs that might regulate breast cancer metastasis, we selected 10 cancer-associated miRNAs for further characterization due to their concordant identification among expression profiling studies of clinical breast tumors (Iorio et al., 2005; Volinia et al., 2006), global analysis of miRNA copy-number variation in human breast carcinomas (Zhang et al., 2006), and localization of miRNA loci to cancer-relevant sites of chromosomal aberration (Calin et al., 2004) (Table S1).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	site	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

The levels of a single miRNA, miR-31, were specifically attenuated in aggressive human breast cancer cells when compared to primary normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs).	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

Figure 1 Figure 1 miR-31 Levels Correlate Inversely With Metastatic Ability in Breast Cell Lines Relative to its expression in normal murine mammary gland (NMuMG) cells, miR-31 levels in sub-lines derived from a single murine mammary tumor reflected their capacities to metastasize: miR-31 was reduced by two-fold in metastatic D2.1 and D2A1 cells, but not in non-aggressive D2.OR cells (Figure 1B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

These effects were specifically attributable to the biological activities of miR-31, as equivalent overexpression of a control miRNA, miR-145, failed to influence invasion or motility (Figure 2A and data not shown).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

The consequences of miR-31 expression were not unique to 231 cells: miR-31 reduced invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance, yet did not affect proliferation, in aggressive SUM-159 human breast cancer cells (Figure S2).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

Thus, 231 cells expressing miR-31 were injected into the orthotopic site – the mammary fat pad – of mice.	|	express	|	site	|	ec

As before, when injected orthotopically, miR-31-expressing cells formed large, well-encapsulated primary tumors and also reduced lung metastasis by five-fold (Figures S4B-S4D).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

Orthotopic injection of SUM-159 cells expressing miR-31 further corroborated our earlier findings: miR-31 enhanced primary tumor growth, yet miR-31-expressing tumors were more well-confined than control tumors (Figure S5).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

These observations indicated that the ability of miR-31-expressing cells to form larger, less invasive primary tumors, as well as to seed fewer metastases, is a specific consequence of the biological activities of miR-31.	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

This difference was not a consequence of an inability of miR-31-expressing cells to become lodged initially in the lung microvasculature, as equal numbers of miR-31-expressing and control cells were detected in the lungs 10 minutes and two hours post-injection (Figures 2G and S6A).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Three months after tail vein injection, miR-31-expressing 231 cells generated 40-fold fewer lung metastases than did controls (Figure 2G).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

We also observed a dramatic effect on the size of eventually formed lesions: after three months, miR-31-expressing cells generated only small micrometastases while control cells formed macroscopic metastases; this occurred despite the fact that miR-31-expressing and control cells established comparably sized micrometastases one month post-injection (Figures 2G and S6B).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

The latter are expression constructs that carry miRNA recognition motifs in their 3’ UTR that bind and thus titer miRNAs (Ebert et al., 2007).	|	express	|	bind	|	ec

When stably expressed in immortalized HMECs or tumorigenic but non-metastatic SUM-149 human breast cancer cells, the miR-31 sponge elicited increased invasion, motility, and anoikis resistance without affecting proliferation (Figure S9 and data not shown).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

Within one day, miR-31 inhibition enhanced cell number in the lungs by six-fold; similarly, at later times after injection, miR-31 sponge-expressing cells were 10-fold more prevalent in the lungs than were controls (Figure 3G).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

The differing metastatic abilities of control and miR-31 sponge-expressing cells did not arise due to failure of control cells to become lodged initially in the lung vasculature, as equal numbers of cells from each cohort were present 10 minutes after injection (Figures 3G and S11).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Suppression of miR-31 also affected lesion size four months after tail vein injection: whereas control cells formed only small micrometastases, miR-31 sponge-expressing cells produced macroscopic metastases (Figure 3G).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

miR-31 Directly Regulates a Cohort of Pro-Metastatic Genes  miR-31’s ability to impede multiple steps of the invasion-metastasis cascade might derive from its ability to pleiotropically regulate genes involved in diverse aspects of metastatic dissemination.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Figure 4 Figure 4 miR-31 Directly Regulates a Cohort of Pro-Metastatic Genes Endogenous Fzd3, ITGA5, MMP16, RDX, and RhoA protein levels were assayed in miR-31-expressing 231 cells.	|	express	|	protein	|	ec

miR-31 did not affect CXCL12 mRNA levels – a computationally predicted miR-31 target found not to be regulated by this miRNA – in either cell type (Figures 4A and 4D).	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

These data indicated that miR-31 directly regulates endogenous Fzd3, ITGA5, M-RIP, MMP16, RDX and RhoA expression in human breast cancer cells.	|	express	|	cancer	|	regul	|	human	|	ec

Transfection with siRNAs potently reduced target protein levels without affecting cell viability (Figures S12A and S12B).	|	target	|	protein	|	ec

We evaluated if re-expression of any of the six targets rescued miR-31’s effects on anoikis.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

Thus, we stably re-expressed miRNA-resistant RhoA in 231 cells that already had been infected with either miR-31 or control vector (Figures S14A and S14B).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

To ascertain if restored RhoA levels reversed in vivo metastasis phenotypes ascribable to miR-31, we orthotopically injected mice with 231 cells expressing combinations of miR-31, RhoA, and control vectors.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

RhoA initially augmented primary tumor growth in the presence of ectopic miR-31, but failed to do so in control 231 cells (Figure 6A).	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

In control 231 cells, ectopic RhoA failed to exacerbate the extent of local invasion; in contrast, RhoA abolished the previously encapsulated appearance of miR-31-expressing tumors and enabled invasion into surrounding normal tissue (Figures 6B and 6C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

Figure 6 Figure 6 Re-Expression of RhoA Partially Reverses miR-31-Imposed Metastasis Defects in vivo Re-expression of RhoA restored lung metastasis in miR-31-expressing 231 cells to 75% of control cell levels, while RhoA failed to enhance metastasis in control 231 cells (Figure 6D).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

While expression of miR-31 and/or RhoA failed to affect the initial lodging of tumor cells in the lung vasculature, the number of cells that persisted in the lungs differed within one day of injection (Figures 6E and S15).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

While expression of RhoA in control 231 cells failed to enhance metastasis, RhoA restored the number of lung metastases to 60% of control cell levels in miR-31-expressing cells; however, RhoA did not facilitate the formation of macroscopic metastases in cells with ectopic miR-31 (Figure 6E).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

miR-31 Expression Correlates Inversely With Metastasis in Human Breast Tumors  Because established cell lines and xenograft studies cannot fully recapitulate clinical malignancy, we extended our analyses by assaying miR-31 expression in specimens from 56 human breast cancer patients (Table S5; Median follow-up = 59 months).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	line	|	ec

When these 56 tumors were stratified based on clinical progression, we found that miR-31 expression was diminished in primary tumors that subsequently metastasized, when compared to normal breast tissue and primary tumors that did not recur; moreover, low miR-31 levels correlated strongly with reduced distant disease-free survival relative to tumors with high miR-31 (Figures 7A and 7B).	|	express	|	tumor	|	free	|	ec

miR-31 was expressed in 65% of the cells in these primary tumors; however, miR-31 was detected in only 12–30% of cells in patient-matched distant metastases (Figure 7C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

These data raise the possibility that selective pressures operating over the course of breast cancer progression diminish the representation of miR-31-expressing cells within the population of successfully metastasizing cells.	|	express	|	cancer	|	ec

RDX and RhoA were expressed in 60–75% of cells in the primary tumors examined, while ITGA5 was detected in >80% of cells (Figure 7D).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

Moreover, miR-31 levels correlate inversely with metastatic recurrence in a cohort of human breast tumors, a preliminary association that appears to persist independent of both tumor grade and subtype.	|	tumor	|	human	|	ec

Given the capacity of miR-31 to enhance primary tumor growth, an oncogenic role for this miRNA (mechanistically independent of its metastasis-suppressive functions) cannot be formally excluded.	|	tumor	|	ec	|	oncogen

Such duality of action is not unprecedented (Massagué, 2008), and is consistent with notions that metastasis- and tumorigenesis-enabling attributes can be biologically distinct and acquired via independent selective pressures during malignant progression.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

The levels of several functionally relevant effectors of miR-31 correlate with disease progression in human tumors.	|	tumor	|	human	|	ec

Re-expression of several individual miR-31 targets largely reversed miR-31-imposed defects in vitro.	|	express	|	target	|	ec

This may indicate that certain miR-31 effectors activate one another; however, ectopic ITGA5, RDX, or RhoA did not induce the expression of other miR-31 targets (data not shown).	|	express	|	target	|	ec

For example, cell lines accumulate genetic changes in culture, while xenografts fail to recapitulate species-specific interactions between tumor cells and their stroma.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Briefly, after a four hour pre-hybridization, a 5’ FITC-labeled miRCURY LNA probe targeting miR-31 (Exiqon) was hybridized to proteinase K-treated 10 ?m sections at 55°C for 12 hours.	|	target	|	protein	|	ec

Tumors were considered miR-31-positive or -negative if the normalized expression of miR-31 resided in the top or bottom 30% of tumors in this cohort, respectively.	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

For spontaneous metastasis assays, age-matched female NOD/SCID mice (propagated on-site) were bilaterally injected into the mammary fat pad with the indicated number of tumor cells in 1:2 Matrigel (BD Biosciences) plus normal growth media.	|	tumor	|	site	|	ec

Tumors were considered target signature-positive or -negative if the normalized expression of multiple of the six miR-31 targets herein identified resided in the top or bottom 15% of tumors in this cohort, respectively.	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	ec

Primary tumors derived from miR-31 sponge-expressing cells were poorly encapsulated and locally invasive, while control MCF7-Ras tumors appeared well-confined and non-invasive (Figures 3D and 3E).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

Strikingly, miR-31 sponge-expressing MCF7-Ras cells metastasized to the lungs in significant numbers, while control tumor-bearing host lungs were largely devoid of tumor cells; cells with impaired miR-31 activity formed 10-fold more lesions than did controls (Figure 3F).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

Within one day, miR-31 inhibition enhanced cell number in the lungs by six-fold; similarly, at later times after injection, miR-31 sponge-expressing cells were 10-fold more prevalent in the lungs than were controls (Figure 3G).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

In consonance with our earlier findings, control 231 primary tumors were locally invasive, while miR-31-expressing tumors were non-invasive (Figures 6B and 6C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	control

In control 231 cells, ectopic RhoA failed to exacerbate the extent of local invasion; in contrast, RhoA abolished the previously encapsulated appearance of miR-31-expressing tumors and enabled invasion into surrounding normal tissue (Figures 6B and 6C).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

The human genome contains a dozen of let-7 family members, organized in eight different loci (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sequences/mirna_summary.pl?fam=MIPF0000002).	|	mirna	|	microrna	|	human

Go to: Introduction Sixteen years ago in back-to-back papers in Cell, Ambros, Ruvkun and their colleagues reported that a small RNA encoded by the lin-4 locus was capable of controlling the developmental timing of the nematode C. elegans by modulating the expression of a protein-coding gene lin-14 (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et al., 1993).	|	express	|	gene	|	protein	|	control

miRNAs act by modulating the expression of target genes via sequence complementarity between the so-called “seed” sequence of the miRNA and the “seed-match” present in the mRNA.	|	express	|	target	|	gene

Such binding inhibits the translation and reduces the stability of the target mRNA, leading to decreased expression of the target protein (reviewed in Eulalio et al., 2008)).	|	express	|	target	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec

Go to: A plethora of possible oncogenic mechanisms Because miRNAs act by repressing gene expression through direct base-pairing interactions with their target mRNAs, there are several possible mechanisms through which miRNAs could affect tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Overexpression, amplification or loss of epigenetic silencing of a gene encoding a miRNA that targets a (or multiple) tumor suppressor gene(s) could inhibit the activity of an anti-oncogenic pathway.	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

By contrast, the physical deletion or epigenetic silencing of a miRNA that normally functions to repress expression of one or more oncogenes might lead to increased protein expression and gain of oncogenic potency.	|	express	|	gene	|	protein	|	oncogen

These range from genomic and gene expression alterations affecting miRNA genes in human cancers to observations in genetically-engineered mouse models of the disease.	|	express	|	cancer	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

Moreover, miRNA expression profiling studies comparing cancer tissue to normal tissue have revealed provocative patterns of miRNA expression, some of which have been linked to changes in methylation status of the miRNA genes (Reviewed in Saito and Jones, 2006).	|	express	|	cancer	|	gene

Go to: miRNAs as Oncogenes miRNAs that are amplified or over-expressed in cancer could function as oncogenes, and a number of putative oncogenic miRNAs have been proposed.	|	express	|	cancer	|	gene	|	oncogen

miR-17~92 is also frequently over-expressed in several other human cancers, including lung cancers (Hayashita et al., 2005), hepatocarcinomas (Connolly et al., 2008), neuroblastomas (Schulte et al., 2008), and colorectal cancers (He et al., 2005).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

While miR-17~92 deregulation does not appear to be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis per se, transgenic mice over-expressing this cluster in lymphocyte progenitors cells develop a lymphoproliferative disorder affecting both B and T cells that eventually results in autoimmunity (Xiao et al., 2008).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Its 3?UTR contains multiple binding sites for miRNAs encoded by miR-17~92 and, consistent with Bim being a direct target of miR-17~92, its levels are increased in miR-17~92 –null pre-B cells and reduced in B cell from mice overexpressing miR-17~92.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

While Bim appears to be a functionally relevant target of miR-17~92, the expression of many other genes is likely to be controlled by this cluster, and many other putative targets have been identified (Dews et al., 2006; Fontana et al., 2008; Fontana et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Petrocca et al., 2008).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	control

Go to: miRNAs as tumor suppressors Several miRNAs have been implicated as tumor suppressors based on their physical deletion or reduced expression in human cancer.	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human

This mutation has been linked to a reduced expression of miR-16-1, possibly due to less efficient processing of the precursor RNA, but large scale studies are needed to determine whether this is indeed a cancer-predisposing mutation.	|	express	|	cancer	|	ec

In the same study, the therapeutic potential of reconstituting expression of this cluster was illustrated by the significant regression of prostatic tumor xenografts upon intra-tumoral delivery of miR-15a and miR-16-1.	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

In the best example of an oncogenic mutation affecting a miRNA binding site, translocations involving the HMGA2 oncogene remove functional let-7 seed-match sequences, causing over-expression of the oncoprotein (Lee and Dutta, 2007; Mayr et al., 2007).	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec	|	oncogen

Finally, over-expression of let-7 miRNAs can suppress tumor development in mouse models of breast and lung cancer (Esquela-Kerscher et al., 2008; Kumar et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2007).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer

Reduced expression of miR-34b/miR-34c has been reported in breast and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (Bommer et al., 2007; Calin et al., 2004).	|	express	|	cancer	|	line

Interestingly, this region includes another candidate tumor suppressor gene, CDH5, that acts by inducing p53 expression via p19Arf (Bagchi et al., 2007).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

Ectopic expression of miR-10b in non-metastatic breast cancer cell lines promotes cellular invasiveness and the metastatic spread of transplanted tumors, at least in part as a consequence of the direct repression of the homeobox protein HOXD10 (Ma et al., 2007).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

Based on their differential expression in non-metastatic versus metastatic breast cancer cell lines, miR-126, miR-206 and miR-335 were also proposed to be inhibitors of tumor progression (Tavazoie et al., 2008).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	line

Indeed, over-expression of these miRNAs can inhibit metastasis in a cell transplantation model and reduced expression of miR-126 and miR-335 correlates with poor metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients (Tavazoie et al., 2008).	|	express	|	cancer	|	free

However, recent work has also revealed intriguing changes in the global state of miRNA expression in cancer.	|	express	|	cancer	|	ec

Specifically, miRNA expression profiling experiments have demonstrated that most (although not all) miRNAs are under-expressed in tumor tissue compared to normal (Lu et al., 2005).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

Similar to the miRNA field as a whole, the discovery of the physiologically relevant targets of these cancer-associated miRNAs is still lagging, but here, too, there has been recent progress with interesting candidate targets emerging.	|	target	|	cancer	|	ec

Its 3?UTR contains multiple binding sites for miRNAs encoded by miR-17~92 and, consistent with Bim being a direct target of miR-17~92, its levels are increased in miR-17~92 –null pre-B cells and reduced in B cell from mice overexpressing miR-17~92.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

While Bim appears to be a functionally relevant target of miR-17~92, the expression of many other genes is likely to be controlled by this cluster, and many other putative targets have been identified (Dews et al., 2006; Fontana et al., 2008; Fontana et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Petrocca et al., 2008).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	control

Beginning with the work of Croce and colleagues in 2002 (Calin et al., 2002), who showed that a pair of neighboring miRNAs are frequently focally deleted in human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; see below), there are now several examples in which miRNA genes are either lost or amplified in tumors (Reviewed in Calin and Croce, 2006).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human

Functional studies performed in cancer cell lines or mouse models of the disease have provided further support for a direct role of a subset of these miRNAs in tumorigenesis.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

In an important in vivo test of the oncogenic potential of miR-17~92, He et al. demonstrated that a truncated version of the cluster (lacking miR-92) could cooperate with c-Myc and greatly accelerate tumorigenesis in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma (He et al., 2005).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

While miR-17~92 deregulation does not appear to be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis per se, transgenic mice over-expressing this cluster in lymphocyte progenitors cells develop a lymphoproliferative disorder affecting both B and T cells that eventually results in autoimmunity (Xiao et al., 2008).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Of note, miR-373 had been previously identified as a potential oncogene (together with miR-372) in testicular germ-cell tumors (Voorhoeve et al., 2006), although it has been proposed that the prometastatic and the oncogenic properties of this miRNA are due to the regulation of different genes (CD44 and LATS2, respectively).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

In an elegant set of genetic experiments in mice, two groups have shown that mutating a single recognition site for miR-155 in the 3-UTR of AID can partially phenocopy the consequences of miR-155 deletion (Dorsett et al., 2008; Teng et al., 2008).	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

Its 3?UTR contains multiple binding sites for miRNAs encoded by miR-17~92 and, consistent with Bim being a direct target of miR-17~92, its levels are increased in miR-17~92 –null pre-B cells and reduced in B cell from mice overexpressing miR-17~92.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

In addition, various let-7 genes are located at chromosomal sites deleted in a variety of human cancers (Calin et al., 2004).	|	cancer	|	gene	|	site	|	human

In the best example of an oncogenic mutation affecting a miRNA binding site, translocations involving the HMGA2 oncogene remove functional let-7 seed-match sequences, causing over-expression of the oncoprotein (Lee and Dutta, 2007; Mayr et al., 2007).	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec	|	oncogen

While miR-17~92 deregulation does not appear to be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis per se, transgenic mice over-expressing this cluster in lymphocyte progenitors cells develop a lymphoproliferative disorder affecting both B and T cells that eventually results in autoimmunity (Xiao et al., 2008).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

While the full spectrum of genes regulated by the six miRNAs encoded by the miR-17~92 cluster is still unknown, one candidate, the pro-apoptotic gene Bim, has been proposed to be a likely mediator of the B cell phenotype in miR-17~92-null and in miR-17~92 transgenic mice (Ventura et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2008).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Bim belongs to the family of pro-apoptotic BH3 only proteins, and has long been known to be a critical regulator of B cell survival (Bouillet et al., 1999; Bouillet et al., 2002) and a potent tumor suppressor gene in the E?-Myc model of B cell lymphoma (Egle et al., 2004; Hemann et al., 2005).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	protein

While the identity of the critical targets of these two miRNAs is still unknown, the list of oncogenes that are directly regulated by miR-15a and miR-16-1 include BCL2, CyclinD1 and WNT3A (Bonci et al., 2008; Cimmino et al., 2005).	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

Of note, miR-373 had been previously identified as a potential oncogene (together with miR-372) in testicular germ-cell tumors (Voorhoeve et al., 2006), although it has been proposed that the prometastatic and the oncogenic properties of this miRNA are due to the regulation of different genes (CD44 and LATS2, respectively).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

As is true for protein-coding genes associated with cancer, the most convincing evidence linking miRNAs to tumorigenesis comes from genetic alterations in cancer cells.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	protein

Bim belongs to the family of pro-apoptotic BH3 only proteins, and has long been known to be a critical regulator of B cell survival (Bouillet et al., 1999; Bouillet et al., 2002) and a potent tumor suppressor gene in the E?-Myc model of B cell lymphoma (Egle et al., 2004; Hemann et al., 2005).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	protein

Let-7 genes can also be directly repressed by the c-Myc oncoprotein (Chang et al., 2008) and their precursor RNAs subjected to inhibition of further processing by lin-28 (Newman et al., 2008; Rybak et al., 2008; Viswanathan et al., 2008).	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

In the best example of an oncogenic mutation affecting a miRNA binding site, translocations involving the HMGA2 oncogene remove functional let-7 seed-match sequences, causing over-expression of the oncoprotein (Lee and Dutta, 2007; Mayr et al., 2007).	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec	|	oncogen

Ectopic expression of miR-10b in non-metastatic breast cancer cell lines promotes cellular invasiveness and the metastatic spread of transplanted tumors, at least in part as a consequence of the direct repression of the homeobox protein HOXD10 (Ma et al., 2007).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

A clearer picture will likely emerge as the efforts to re-sequence the cancer genome reveal the true frequency of mutations in miRNAs and in their target sequences in protein-coding genes (although the latter will require specific analysis of the 3? UTR regions).	|	target	|	cancer	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

Functional studies performed in cancer cell lines or mouse models of the disease have provided further support for a direct role of a subset of these miRNAs in tumorigenesis.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Ectopic expression of miR-10b in non-metastatic breast cancer cell lines promotes cellular invasiveness and the metastatic spread of transplanted tumors, at least in part as a consequence of the direct repression of the homeobox protein HOXD10 (Ma et al., 2007).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

Based on their differential expression in non-metastatic versus metastatic breast cancer cell lines, miR-126, miR-206 and miR-335 were also proposed to be inhibitors of tumor progression (Tavazoie et al., 2008).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	line

Although not all of these potential mechanisms have been as yet documented in human cancers, over the past half-dozen years a veritable flood of reports have linked miRNAs to tumor development in one fashion or another.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	human	|	protein	|	ec	|	oncogen

These range from genomic and gene expression alterations affecting miRNA genes in human cancers to observations in genetically-engineered mouse models of the disease.	|	express	|	cancer	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

Functional studies performed in cancer cell lines or mouse models of the disease have provided further support for a direct role of a subset of these miRNAs in tumorigenesis.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	line	|	ec

Similar to the miRNA field as a whole, the discovery of the physiologically relevant targets of these cancer-associated miRNAs is still lagging, but here, too, there has been recent progress with interesting candidate targets emerging.	|	target	|	cancer	|	ec

In an elegant set of genetic experiments in mice, two groups have shown that mutating a single recognition site for miR-155 in the 3-UTR of AID can partially phenocopy the consequences of miR-155 deletion (Dorsett et al., 2008; Teng et al., 2008).	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

miR-17~92 is also frequently over-expressed in several other human cancers, including lung cancers (Hayashita et al., 2005), hepatocarcinomas (Connolly et al., 2008), neuroblastomas (Schulte et al., 2008), and colorectal cancers (He et al., 2005).	|	express	|	cancer	|	human	|	ec

While miR-17~92 deregulation does not appear to be sufficient to initiate tumorigenesis per se, transgenic mice over-expressing this cluster in lymphocyte progenitors cells develop a lymphoproliferative disorder affecting both B and T cells that eventually results in autoimmunity (Xiao et al., 2008).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

While the full spectrum of genes regulated by the six miRNAs encoded by the miR-17~92 cluster is still unknown, one candidate, the pro-apoptotic gene Bim, has been proposed to be a likely mediator of the B cell phenotype in miR-17~92-null and in miR-17~92 transgenic mice (Ventura et al., 2008; Xiao et al., 2008).	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Its 3?UTR contains multiple binding sites for miRNAs encoded by miR-17~92 and, consistent with Bim being a direct target of miR-17~92, its levels are increased in miR-17~92 –null pre-B cells and reduced in B cell from mice overexpressing miR-17~92.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	bind	|	ec

The miR-15a~16-1 cluster of miRNAs has recently emerged as an excellent candidate to be the long sought-after tumor suppressor gene on 13q14.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

This mutation has been linked to a reduced expression of miR-16-1, possibly due to less efficient processing of the precursor RNA, but large scale studies are needed to determine whether this is indeed a cancer-predisposing mutation.	|	express	|	cancer	|	ec

In the same study, the therapeutic potential of reconstituting expression of this cluster was illustrated by the significant regression of prostatic tumor xenografts upon intra-tumoral delivery of miR-15a and miR-16-1.	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

While the identity of the critical targets of these two miRNAs is still unknown, the list of oncogenes that are directly regulated by miR-15a and miR-16-1 include BCL2, CyclinD1 and WNT3A (Bonci et al., 2008; Cimmino et al., 2005).	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

Let-7 genes can also be directly repressed by the c-Myc oncoprotein (Chang et al., 2008) and their precursor RNAs subjected to inhibition of further processing by lin-28 (Newman et al., 2008; Rybak et al., 2008; Viswanathan et al., 2008).	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

In the best example of an oncogenic mutation affecting a miRNA binding site, translocations involving the HMGA2 oncogene remove functional let-7 seed-match sequences, causing over-expression of the oncoprotein (Lee and Dutta, 2007; Mayr et al., 2007).	|	express	|	gene	|	site	|	bind	|	protein	|	ec	|	oncogen

A series of recent reports has explored the regulation of miRNAs by tumor suppressor genes.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

The transcription of both loci appears to be directly regulated by p53 via binding to conserved sites in the respective promoters (Chang et al., 2007; Corney et al., 2007; He et al., 2007a; Raver-Shapira et al., 2007; Tarasov et al., 2007; Wei et al., 2006).	|	site	|	regul	|	bind	|	ec

Ectopic expression of miR-10b in non-metastatic breast cancer cell lines promotes cellular invasiveness and the metastatic spread of transplanted tumors, at least in part as a consequence of the direct repression of the homeobox protein HOXD10 (Ma et al., 2007).	|	express	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	protein	|	line	|	ec

Of note, miR-373 had been previously identified as a potential oncogene (together with miR-372) in testicular germ-cell tumors (Voorhoeve et al., 2006), although it has been proposed that the prometastatic and the oncogenic properties of this miRNA are due to the regulation of different genes (CD44 and LATS2, respectively).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

Go to: Global deregulation of miRNAs in cancer In this review, we have focused on the role of specific miRNAs in tumorigenesis, an already extensive and rapidly expanding list.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

However, recent work has also revealed intriguing changes in the global state of miRNA expression in cancer.	|	express	|	cancer	|	ec

Specifically, miRNA expression profiling experiments have demonstrated that most (although not all) miRNAs are under-expressed in tumor tissue compared to normal (Lu et al., 2005).	|	express	|	tumor	|	ec

While it is possible that this phenomenon reflects the less differentiated state of the tumor cells and/or their higher proliferation rate, one alternative explanation is that reduced miRNA levels are selected for during tumorigenesis because this itself provide some proliferative or survival advantage.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

A clearer picture will likely emerge as the efforts to re-sequence the cancer genome reveal the true frequency of mutations in miRNAs and in their target sequences in protein-coding genes (although the latter will require specific analysis of the 3? UTR regions).	|	target	|	cancer	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

As the deregulation of these very same processes are hallmarks of cancer, it has been speculated for some time that mutations affecting miRNAs and/or their functional interaction with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes might also participate to tumorigenesis.	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

Go to: A plethora of possible oncogenic mechanisms Because miRNAs act by repressing gene expression through direct base-pairing interactions with their target mRNAs, there are several possible mechanisms through which miRNAs could affect tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Overexpression, amplification or loss of epigenetic silencing of a gene encoding a miRNA that targets a (or multiple) tumor suppressor gene(s) could inhibit the activity of an anti-oncogenic pathway.	|	express	|	target	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

By contrast, the physical deletion or epigenetic silencing of a miRNA that normally functions to repress expression of one or more oncogenes might lead to increased protein expression and gain of oncogenic potency.	|	express	|	gene	|	protein	|	oncogen

In an important in vivo test of the oncogenic potential of miR-17~92, He et al. demonstrated that a truncated version of the cluster (lacking miR-92) could cooperate with c-Myc and greatly accelerate tumorigenesis in a mouse model of B cell lymphoma (He et al., 2005).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

While the identity of the critical targets of these two miRNAs is still unknown, the list of oncogenes that are directly regulated by miR-15a and miR-16-1 include BCL2, CyclinD1 and WNT3A (Bonci et al., 2008; Cimmino et al., 2005).	|	target	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

Go to: Introduction Sixteen years ago in back-to-back papers in Cell, Ambros, Ruvkun and their colleagues reported that a small RNA encoded by the lin-4 locus was capable of controlling the developmental timing of the nematode C. elegans by modulating the expression of a protein-coding gene lin-14 (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et al., 1993).	|	express	|	gene	|	protein	|	control

In this review, we summarize recent findings that now overwhelmingly support an important role for these tiny RNAs in controlling cell transformation and tumor progression as well as the critical questions that remain to be answered.	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

While Bim appears to be a functionally relevant target of miR-17~92, the expression of many other genes is likely to be controlled by this cluster, and many other putative targets have been identified (Dews et al., 2006; Fontana et al., 2008; Fontana et al., 2007; Lu et al., 2007; Petrocca et al., 2008).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	control

To perform genetic screens for novel functions of miRNAs, we developed a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and created corresponding DNA barcode arrays.	|	express	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

These miRNAs neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition, possibly through direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2.	|	express	|	tumor	|	utr	|	ec

Relevant to carcinogenesis, it was found that let-7 inhibits RAS expression and in lung tumors negatively correlates with RAS levels (Johnson et al., 2005).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

For example, the joint expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT), oncogenic H-RASV12, and SV40-small t antigen combined with the suppression of p53 and p16INK4A were sufficient to render primary human fibroblasts tumorigenic (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).	|	express	|	tumor	|	human	|	oncogen

We characterize two miRNAs whose expression can substitute for the loss of wild-type (wt) p53 that is needed to overcome oncogene-mediated arrest and implicate their involvement in the formation of testicular germ cell tumors.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

To examine miRNA expression from the miR-Vec system, a miR-24 minigene-containing virus was transduced into human cells.	|	express	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

Figure 1C shows that cells transduced with miR-Vec-24 clearly express high levels of mature miR-24, whereas little expression was detected in control-transduced cells.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Figure options Next, we examined the functionality of the miR-Vec system to suppress gene expression by using both GFP, tagged with a sequence complementary to miR-19, and luciferase containing either the wt 3?UTR of G6PD, a predicted miR-1 target, or control with two mutated miR-1 binding sequences (Lewis et al., 2003).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

These results demonstrate the general applicability of miR-Vec to drive functional miRNA expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

miR-Lib and miR-Array We subsequently created a human miRNA expression library (miR-Lib) by cloning almost all annotated human miRNAs into our vector (Rfam release 6) (Figure S3).	|	express	|	human	|	ec

The expression of either miR-371&2 or miR-373 allowed cells to continue proliferating in the presence of oncogenic stress, validating the effect observed with the miR-Array.	|	express	|	ec	|	oncogen

We also generated BJ/ET cells expressing the RASV12-ERTAM chimera gene, which is only active when tamoxifen is added (De Vita et al., 2005), and tranduced them with either YFP-tagged wt or mutant miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-Vec-373 constructs as well as p53kd, p14ARFkd, or control vectors.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

To mimic the expression of the complete miR-371-373 gene cluster, we made a miR-Vec expressing all miRNAs from one cluster (miR-Vec-cluster; see Figure 3A for expression).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

To shed more light on this aspect, we examined the effect of miR-372&3 expression on p53 activation in response to oncogenic stimulation.	|	express	|	ec	|	oncogen

(D) The expression of miR-372 was detected by RPA in RNA extracts from several TGCT cell lines as well as from primary seminoma and nonseminoma tumors and from normal testis tissues.	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

In the presence of both miRNAs, and irrespective of RASV12 expression, IR induced a cell cycle arrest that was indistinguishable from control cells, whereas the suppression of p53 expression allowed, as expected, continuous DNA replication (Figure 4C and data not shown).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

This result is significant as no clear expression of the miR-371-3 cluster was detected in any of the somatic cell lines we tested (originating from breast, colon, lung and brain tumors) (Figure S6).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

Noteworthy is the fact that endogenous expression of miR-372 reached levels that are comparable to those driven by miR-Vec-372 (Figure 4D), indicating the biological relevance of our system in primary human fibroblast cells.	|	express	|	human	|	ec

In many of the miR-371-3 expressing seminomas and nonseminomas, miR-302a-d was undetectable (Figures S7 and S8), suggesting that miR-371-3 expression is a selective event during tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Whereas all three cluster-expressing cell lines contained high wt-p53 levels, NTera2 has low wild-type p53 levels, and NCCIT lost one p53 allele while the second allele is mutated (Burger et al., 1998).	|	express	|	line	|	ec

It was technically not possible to sufficiently and persistently inhibit the expression of both miR-372 and miR-373 by methylated miRNA-oligos or knockdown vectors against the loop of the precursors (as judged by miR-372 and miR-373 luciferase reporter targets; data not shown).	|	express	|	target	|	ec

We first looked in the p53kd cells and found p53 itself and many of its transcriptional targets to be downregulated compared to the cluster-expressing cells (Figure 5A).	|	express	|	target	|	regul

From the list of genes whose expression was 2- or more fold lower in the cluster-expressing cells, we used target prediction programs to find possible direct targets of miR-372&3.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Listed are genes whose expression was downregulated in the p53kd cells and are known transcriptional targets of p53 as well as genes whose expression was suppressed in the cluster-expressing cells and are predicted TargetScanS targets of miRNA-372&3.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

Figure options To investigate the possibility that miR-372 and miR-373 suppress the expression of LATS2, we performed immunoblot analysis of cells expressing wt and mutant miR-372&3, the cluster and the controls p53kd and empty vector.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Significantly, a potent inhibition of luciferase activity was also mediated by the 3?UTR of LATS2 in either MCF-7 ectopically expressing miR-372 or in Tera1 cells but not by a construct mutated at both miR-372-predicted target sites.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	ec

In both primary human fibroblasts and in a TGCT-derived cell line, cells expressing miR-372&3 were insensitive to elevated levels of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21cip1.	|	express	|	human	|	line

Indeed, the expression of LATS2 is directly controlled by miR-372&3, and its activity is important for RASV12-induced senescence.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

To this end, we determined the expression of the miR-371-3 cluster in several distinct somatic tumor cell lines and found little evidence for their expression (Figure S6).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line

It is therefore most likely that the expression of miR-371-3 in primary TGCT is not merely a remnant of their ES cell phenotype but rather a selective event during TGCT tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Our results indicate that due to enhanced tolerance to oncogenic mutations, deregulated expression of miR-372&3 predisposes cells for accumulation of carcinogenic events.	|	express	|	regul	|	oncogen

Thus, the expression of these miRNAs must be carefully controlled during differentiation to prevent progression to cancer.	|	express	|	cancer	|	control

The difficulties in deciphering the mechanism of action of miRNAs with a known function and deducing their activity from their sequence are largely due to the complex relationship with their target genes.	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

In general, target genes containing sequences that are completely complementary to the miRNA will be degraded by an RNA-interference mechanism, whereas targets with partial complementary sequences at their 3?UTR will be subjected to translation inhibition and to a lesser extent also to mRNA degradation (Doench and Sharp, 2004, Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

In mammals, a near-perfect complementarity between miRNAs and protein coding genes almost never exists, making it difficult to directly pinpoint relevant downstream targets of a miRNA.	|	target	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

These programs predict dozens to hundreds of target genes per miRNA, making it difficult to directly infer the cellular pathways affected by a given miRNA.	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Figure options Next, we examined the functionality of the miR-Vec system to suppress gene expression by using both GFP, tagged with a sequence complementary to miR-19, and luciferase containing either the wt 3?UTR of G6PD, a predicted miR-1 target, or control with two mutated miR-1 binding sequences (Lewis et al., 2003).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

From the list of genes whose expression was 2- or more fold lower in the cluster-expressing cells, we used target prediction programs to find possible direct targets of miR-372&3.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

To further substantiate LATS2 as a direct target of miR372&3, we cloned its 3?UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-LATS2).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Significantly, a potent inhibition of luciferase activity was also mediated by the 3?UTR of LATS2 in either MCF-7 ectopically expressing miR-372 or in Tera1 cells but not by a construct mutated at both miR-372-predicted target sites.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes.	|	target	|	tumor	|	ec

Further investigation should elucidate the exact role of LATS2 downregulation and the possible participation of other miR-372&3-targets in the overall observed miR effect on cellular transformation.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

Indeed, preliminary results show that similar to miR-372&3, albeit with minor differences, both miR-93 and miR-302a-e can effectively target the LATS2 3?UTR and bypass oncogene-induced senescence (manuscript in preparation).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

The genes that decreased 2-fold or more were further screened for possible miR-372/3 target sites using a local version of the TargetScan algorithm (Lewis et al., 2003) with default parameters (http://www.mekentosj.com/targetscanner).	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	oncogen

These miRNAs neutralize p53-mediated CDK inhibition, possibly through direct inhibition of the expression of the tumor-suppressor LATS2.	|	express	|	tumor	|	utr	|	ec

We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	oncogen

Relevant to carcinogenesis, it was found that let-7 inhibits RAS expression and in lung tumors negatively correlates with RAS levels (Johnson et al., 2005).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

For example, the joint expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT), oncogenic H-RASV12, and SV40-small t antigen combined with the suppression of p53 and p16INK4A were sufficient to render primary human fibroblasts tumorigenic (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).	|	express	|	tumor	|	human	|	oncogen

Recently, these neoplastic transformation assays were used to uncover novel human tumor suppressor genes (Kolfschoten et al., 2005 and Westbrook et al., 2005).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

The elimination of this protective mechanism by, for example, the suppression of the p53 and p16INK4A pathways permits continued proliferation of the modified primary cells in the presence of the oncogenic event, consequently leading to tumorigenicity (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).	|	tumor	|	ec	|	oncogen

Here, we use this model system to perform a functional genetic screen to identify miRNAs that act as oncogenes in tumorigenesis.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

We characterize two miRNAs whose expression can substitute for the loss of wild-type (wt) p53 that is needed to overcome oncogene-mediated arrest and implicate their involvement in the formation of testicular germ cell tumors.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

This escape from oncogene-induced senescence is a prerequisite for full transformation into tumor cells.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	site	|	oncogen

To identify miRNAs that can interfere with this process and thus might contribute to the development of tumor cells, we transduced BJ/ET fibroblasts with miR-Lib and subsequently transduced them with either RASV12 or a control vector (Figure 2B).	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

(E) The cluster, p53kd, and control cell populations from (C) were injected subcutaneously in athymic nude mice, and tumor growth was scored 5 weeks later.	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

(D) The expression of miR-372 was detected by RPA in RNA extracts from several TGCT cell lines as well as from primary seminoma and nonseminoma tumors and from normal testis tissues.	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

This result is significant as no clear expression of the miR-371-3 cluster was detected in any of the somatic cell lines we tested (originating from breast, colon, lung and brain tumors) (Figure S6).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

In many of the miR-371-3 expressing seminomas and nonseminomas, miR-302a-d was undetectable (Figures S7 and S8), suggesting that miR-371-3 expression is a selective event during tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

To strengthen the p53 connection seen in the TGCT cell lines, we examined p53 mutations in exons five to eight in the primary tumors, where the majority of mutations are found.	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

Finally, in human breast cancer, hypermethylation of the LATS2 promoter was associated with an aggressive phenotype of the tumors (Takahashi et al., 2005).	|	tumor	|	cancer	|	human

Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes.	|	target	|	tumor	|	ec

Collaboration of miRNA372&3 and RASV12 in Tumorigenesis Sustained proliferation of cells in the presence of oncogenic signals is a major leap toward tumorigenicity (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

To this end, we determined the expression of the miR-371-3 cluster in several distinct somatic tumor cell lines and found little evidence for their expression (Figure S6).	|	express	|	tumor	|	line

It is therefore most likely that the expression of miR-371-3 in primary TGCT is not merely a remnant of their ES cell phenotype but rather a selective event during TGCT tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

To perform genetic screens for novel functions of miRNAs, we developed a library of vectors expressing the majority of cloned human miRNAs and created corresponding DNA barcode arrays.	|	express	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	oncogen

We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	oncogen

Relevant to carcinogenesis, it was found that let-7 inhibits RAS expression and in lung tumors negatively correlates with RAS levels (Johnson et al., 2005).	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene

The difficulties in deciphering the mechanism of action of miRNAs with a known function and deducing their activity from their sequence are largely due to the complex relationship with their target genes.	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

In general, target genes containing sequences that are completely complementary to the miRNA will be degraded by an RNA-interference mechanism, whereas targets with partial complementary sequences at their 3?UTR will be subjected to translation inhibition and to a lesser extent also to mRNA degradation (Doench and Sharp, 2004, Bagga et al., 2005, Lim et al., 2005 and Pillai et al., 2005).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

In mammals, a near-perfect complementarity between miRNAs and protein coding genes almost never exists, making it difficult to directly pinpoint relevant downstream targets of a miRNA.	|	target	|	gene	|	protein	|	ec

These programs predict dozens to hundreds of target genes per miRNA, making it difficult to directly infer the cellular pathways affected by a given miRNA.	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Furthermore, the biological effect of the downregulation depends greatly on the cellular context, which exemplifies the need to deduce miRNA functions by in vivo genetic screens in well-defined model systems.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec

Recently, these neoplastic transformation assays were used to uncover novel human tumor suppressor genes (Kolfschoten et al., 2005 and Westbrook et al., 2005).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

Here, we use this model system to perform a functional genetic screen to identify miRNAs that act as oncogenes in tumorigenesis.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

To examine miRNA expression from the miR-Vec system, a miR-24 minigene-containing virus was transduced into human cells.	|	express	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

Figure options Next, we examined the functionality of the miR-Vec system to suppress gene expression by using both GFP, tagged with a sequence complementary to miR-19, and luciferase containing either the wt 3?UTR of G6PD, a predicted miR-1 target, or control with two mutated miR-1 binding sequences (Lewis et al., 2003).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

These results demonstrate the general applicability of miR-Vec to drive functional miRNA expression.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

Expression of miR-372 and miR-373 Protects from Oncogenic Stress In response to mitogenic signals from oncogenes such as RASV12, primary human cells undergo a growth arrest (Figure 2A) (Serrano et al., 1997).	|	gene	|	human	|	ec	|	oncogen

Identification of miR-Vecs that Inhibit Oncogene-Induced Senescence (A) The effects of oncogenic RASV12 on cellular growth.	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

We also generated BJ/ET cells expressing the RASV12-ERTAM chimera gene, which is only active when tamoxifen is added (De Vita et al., 2005), and tranduced them with either YFP-tagged wt or mutant miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-Vec-373 constructs as well as p53kd, p14ARFkd, or control vectors.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

Once RASV12 was activated, the growth advantage of cells with miR-Vec-371&2 and 373 increased dramatically, indicating that these constructs allowed growth of cells in the presence of oncogenes while the rest of the population ceased to proliferate.	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

To mimic the expression of the complete miR-371-373 gene cluster, we made a miR-Vec expressing all miRNAs from one cluster (miR-Vec-cluster; see Figure 3A for expression).	|	express	|	gene	|	ec

These results indicate that although miR-372&3 confer complete protection to oncogene-induced senescence in a manner similar to p53 inactivation, the cellular response to DNA damage remains intact.	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

In many of the miR-371-3 expressing seminomas and nonseminomas, miR-302a-d was undetectable (Figures S7 and S8), suggesting that miR-371-3 expression is a selective event during tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

From the list of genes whose expression was 2- or more fold lower in the cluster-expressing cells, we used target prediction programs to find possible direct targets of miR-372&3.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

It was recently shown that lymphocytes from mice nullizygous for Suv39-H1 are resistant to oncogene-induced senescence (Braig et al., 2005).	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Listed are genes whose expression was downregulated in the p53kd cells and are known transcriptional targets of p53 as well as genes whose expression was suppressed in the cluster-expressing cells and are predicted TargetScanS targets of miRNA-372&3.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	regul

To further substantiate LATS2 as a direct target of miR372&3, we cloned its 3?UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-LATS2).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

We demonstrate here the power of this technology by the identification of miRNA-372 and miRNA-373 as potential oncogenes that collaborate with oncogenic RAS in cellular transformation (Figure 5G).	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Collaboration of miRNA372&3 and RASV12 in Tumorigenesis Sustained proliferation of cells in the presence of oncogenic signals is a major leap toward tumorigenicity (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

Indeed, preliminary results show that similar to miR-372&3, albeit with minor differences, both miR-93 and miR-302a-e can effectively target the LATS2 3?UTR and bypass oncogene-induced senescence (manuscript in preparation).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

It is therefore most likely that the expression of miR-371-3 in primary TGCT is not merely a remnant of their ES cell phenotype but rather a selective event during TGCT tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Nevertheless, our experiments stress the importance of a strong downregulation of factors that maintain rapid cell proliferation, as in the absence of this downregulation safeguard mechanisms against oncogene emergence are functionally impaired.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

The elimination of this protective mechanism by, for example, the suppression of the p53 and p16INK4A pathways permits continued proliferation of the modified primary cells in the presence of the oncogenic event, consequently leading to tumorigenicity (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).	|	tumor	|	ec	|	oncogen

Whereas all three cluster-expressing cell lines contained high wt-p53 levels, NTera2 has low wild-type p53 levels, and NCCIT lost one p53 allele while the second allele is mutated (Burger et al., 1998).	|	express	|	line	|	ec

To strengthen the p53 connection seen in the TGCT cell lines, we examined p53 mutations in exons five to eight in the primary tumors, where the majority of mutations are found.	|	tumor	|	line	|	ec

It was technically not possible to sufficiently and persistently inhibit the expression of both miR-372 and miR-373 by methylated miRNA-oligos or knockdown vectors against the loop of the precursors (as judged by miR-372 and miR-373 luciferase reporter targets; data not shown).	|	express	|	target	|	ec

From the list of genes whose expression was 2- or more fold lower in the cluster-expressing cells, we used target prediction programs to find possible direct targets of miR-372&3.	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Figure options To investigate the possibility that miR-372 and miR-373 suppress the expression of LATS2, we performed immunoblot analysis of cells expressing wt and mutant miR-372&3, the cluster and the controls p53kd and empty vector.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

To further substantiate LATS2 as a direct target of miR372&3, we cloned its 3?UTR downstream of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-LATS2).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec

Significantly, a potent inhibition of luciferase activity was also mediated by the 3?UTR of LATS2 in either MCF-7 ectopically expressing miR-372 or in Tera1 cells but not by a construct mutated at both miR-372-predicted target sites.	|	express	|	target	|	site	|	ec

Therefore, these results point to LATS2 as a mediator of the miR-372 and miR-373 effects on cell proliferation and tumorigenicity, although they do not exclude the participation of other direct miR-targets, such as Suv39-H1, in these processes.	|	target	|	tumor	|	ec

Further investigation should elucidate the exact role of LATS2 downregulation and the possible participation of other miR-372&3-targets in the overall observed miR effect on cellular transformation.	|	target	|	regul	|	ec

We demonstrate here the power of this technology by the identification of miRNA-372 and miRNA-373 as potential oncogenes that collaborate with oncogenic RAS in cellular transformation (Figure 5G).	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Indeed, the expression of LATS2 is directly controlled by miR-372&3, and its activity is important for RASV12-induced senescence.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Indeed, preliminary results show that similar to miR-372&3, albeit with minor differences, both miR-93 and miR-302a-e can effectively target the LATS2 3?UTR and bypass oncogene-induced senescence (manuscript in preparation).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

It is therefore most likely that the expression of miR-371-3 in primary TGCT is not merely a remnant of their ES cell phenotype but rather a selective event during TGCT tumorigenesis.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	ec

Nevertheless, our experiments stress the importance of a strong downregulation of factors that maintain rapid cell proliferation, as in the absence of this downregulation safeguard mechanisms against oncogene emergence are functionally impaired.	|	gene	|	regul	|	ec	|	oncogen

The miRNA minigenes were PCR amplified from genomic human DNA, cloned downstream of the CMV promoter in miR-Vec, and sequence verified.	|	gene	|	human	|	ec

The genes that decreased 2-fold or more were further screened for possible miR-372/3 target sites using a local version of the TargetScan algorithm (Lewis et al., 2003) with default parameters (http://www.mekentosj.com/targetscanner).	|	target	|	gene	|	site	|	ec

Bokemeyer Molecular determinants of treatment response in human germ cell tumors Clin.	|	tumor	|	human	|	ec

In a screen for miRNAs that cooperate with oncogenes in cellular transformation, we identified miR-372 and miR-373, each permitting proliferation and tumorigenesis of primary human cells that harbor both oncogenic RAS and active wild-type p53.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	oncogen

We provide evidence that these miRNAs are potential novel oncogenes participating in the development of human testicular germ cell tumors by numbing the p53 pathway, thus allowing tumorigenic growth in the presence of wild-type p53.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	human	|	oncogen

For example, the joint expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase subunit (hTERT), oncogenic H-RASV12, and SV40-small t antigen combined with the suppression of p53 and p16INK4A were sufficient to render primary human fibroblasts tumorigenic (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).	|	express	|	tumor	|	human	|	oncogen

The elimination of this protective mechanism by, for example, the suppression of the p53 and p16INK4A pathways permits continued proliferation of the modified primary cells in the presence of the oncogenic event, consequently leading to tumorigenicity (Voorhoeve and Agami, 2003).	|	tumor	|	ec	|	oncogen

Here, we use this model system to perform a functional genetic screen to identify miRNAs that act as oncogenes in tumorigenesis.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

We characterize two miRNAs whose expression can substitute for the loss of wild-type (wt) p53 that is needed to overcome oncogene-mediated arrest and implicate their involvement in the formation of testicular germ cell tumors.	|	express	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

Expression of miR-372 and miR-373 Protects from Oncogenic Stress In response to mitogenic signals from oncogenes such as RASV12, primary human cells undergo a growth arrest (Figure 2A) (Serrano et al., 1997).	|	gene	|	human	|	ec	|	oncogen

This escape from oncogene-induced senescence is a prerequisite for full transformation into tumor cells.	|	tumor	|	gene	|	site	|	oncogen

Identification of miR-Vecs that Inhibit Oncogene-Induced Senescence (A) The effects of oncogenic RASV12 on cellular growth.	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

The expression of either miR-371&2 or miR-373 allowed cells to continue proliferating in the presence of oncogenic stress, validating the effect observed with the miR-Array.	|	express	|	ec	|	oncogen

Once RASV12 was activated, the growth advantage of cells with miR-Vec-371&2 and 373 increased dramatically, indicating that these constructs allowed growth of cells in the presence of oncogenes while the rest of the population ceased to proliferate.	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

To shed more light on this aspect, we examined the effect of miR-372&3 expression on p53 activation in response to oncogenic stimulation.	|	express	|	ec	|	oncogen

These results indicate that although miR-372&3 confer complete protection to oncogene-induced senescence in a manner similar to p53 inactivation, the cellular response to DNA damage remains intact.	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Collaboration of miRNA372&3 and RASV12 in Tumorigenesis Sustained proliferation of cells in the presence of oncogenic signals is a major leap toward tumorigenicity (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000).	|	tumor	|	gene	|	oncogen

Indeed, preliminary results show that similar to miR-372&3, albeit with minor differences, both miR-93 and miR-302a-e can effectively target the LATS2 3?UTR and bypass oncogene-induced senescence (manuscript in preparation).	|	target	|	gene	|	ec	|	oncogen

Our results indicate that due to enhanced tolerance to oncogenic mutations, deregulated expression of miR-372&3 predisposes cells for accumulation of carcinogenic events.	|	express	|	regul	|	oncogen

Figure 1C shows that cells transduced with miR-Vec-24 clearly express high levels of mature miR-24, whereas little expression was detected in control-transduced cells.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Figure options Next, we examined the functionality of the miR-Vec system to suppress gene expression by using both GFP, tagged with a sequence complementary to miR-19, and luciferase containing either the wt 3?UTR of G6PD, a predicted miR-1 target, or control with two mutated miR-1 binding sequences (Lewis et al., 2003).	|	express	|	target	|	gene	|	bind	|	ec	|	control

To identify miRNAs that can interfere with this process and thus might contribute to the development of tumor cells, we transduced BJ/ET fibroblasts with miR-Lib and subsequently transduced them with either RASV12 or a control vector (Figure 2B).	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

We also generated BJ/ET cells expressing the RASV12-ERTAM chimera gene, which is only active when tamoxifen is added (De Vita et al., 2005), and tranduced them with either YFP-tagged wt or mutant miR-Vec-371&2 and miR-Vec-373 constructs as well as p53kd, p14ARFkd, or control vectors.	|	express	|	gene	|	ec	|	control

(E) The cluster, p53kd, and control cell populations from (C) were injected subcutaneously in athymic nude mice, and tumor growth was scored 5 weeks later.	|	tumor	|	ec	|	control

In the presence of both miRNAs, and irrespective of RASV12 expression, IR induced a cell cycle arrest that was indistinguishable from control cells, whereas the suppression of p53 expression allowed, as expected, continuous DNA replication (Figure 4C and data not shown).	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Figure options To investigate the possibility that miR-372 and miR-373 suppress the expression of LATS2, we performed immunoblot analysis of cells expressing wt and mutant miR-372&3, the cluster and the controls p53kd and empty vector.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Indeed, the expression of LATS2 is directly controlled by miR-372&3, and its activity is important for RASV12-induced senescence.	|	express	|	ec	|	control

Thus, the expression of these miRNAs must be carefully controlled during differentiation to prevent progression to cancer.	|	express	|	cancer	|	control
