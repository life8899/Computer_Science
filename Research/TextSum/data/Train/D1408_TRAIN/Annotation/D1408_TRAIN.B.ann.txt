Therefore, it was important to ensure that the shuffled miRNA controls matched the corresponding miRNAs closely in all sequence properties that impact the expected number and quality of TargetScan target sites. The properties we considered were (1) the expected frequency of seed matches in the UTR dataset; (2) the expected frequency of matching to the 3′ end of the miRNA; (3) the observed count of seed matches in the UTR dataset; and (4) the predicted free energy of a seed:seed match duplex. A miRNA shuffling protocol, MiRshuffle, was developed to generate randomized control sequences that possess all of these properties. For a given miRNA sequence, MiRshuffle generates a series of random permutations with the same length and base composition as the miRNA, until a shuffled sequence is found that matches the parent miRNA closely in each of the four criteria listed above | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

The importance of complementarity to the 5′ portion of invertebrate miRNAs has been suspected since the observation that complementary sites within the lin-14 mRNA have “core elements” of complementarity to the 5′ segment of the lin-4 miRNA (Wightman et al., 1993) and has been corroborated with the observation that the 5′ segments of numerous invertebrate miRNAs are perfectly complementary to 3′ UTR elements that mediate posttranscriptional regulation or are known miRNA targets Lai 2002 and Stark et al. 2003. Moreover, the 5′ ends of related miRNAs tend to be better conserved than the 3′ ends (Lim et al., 2003b), further supporting the hypothesis that these segments are most critical for mRNA recognition. To explore this hypothesis, TargetScan was applied to predict targets of the nrVert miRNA set conserved between human, mouse, and rat using versions of the algorithm differing in the miRNA heptamer defined as the seed in step 1 (Figure 2B). Consistent with residues at the 5′ end of miRNAs being most important for target recognition, the highest signal:noise ratio was observed when the seed was positioned at or near the extreme 5′ end of the miRNA, with signal:noise values of 2.7, 3.4, and 1.6 observed for seeds at segments 1..7, 2..8, and 3..9, respectively, and signal:noise ratios of 1.3 or less at other seed positions. We suggest that the critical importance of pairing to segment 2..8 for target identification in silico reflects its importance for target recognition in vivo and speculate that this segment nucleates pairing between miRNAs and mRNAs | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Of these 11 UTRs, mutations in eight (SMAD-1, SDF-1, BRN-3b, ENX-1, N-MYC, PTEN, Delta1, and Notch1, but not HOX-A5, MECP-2, or VAMP-2) significantly enhanced expression (p < 0.001), as expected if the endogenous miRNAs in the HeLa cells were specifying the repression of reporter gene expression by pairing to the predicted target sites (Figure 3B). Significantly enhanced expression was also observed when the analogous experiment was performed using either the full-length C. elegans lin-41 3′ UTR or a 124 nt segment of the UTR containing the two previously proposed let-7 miRNA target sites (Reinhart et al., 2000), indicating that at least some of the repression of lin-41 observed in C. elegans can be recapitulated by HeLa let-7 miRNA in this heterologous reporter assay (Figure 3B). For all eight predicted human targets of endogenous HeLa miRNAs that responded to mutations, the increase in expression seen when disrupting the pairing to the miRNA seed was at least as high as that seen for mutations in the let-7 target sites of lin-41 (Figure 3B) ...
