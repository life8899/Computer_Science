As described below, these shuffled sequences were carefully screened to ensure that our estimates of noise were as accurate as possible and not artifactually low ... Therefore, it was important to ensure that the shuffled miRNA controls matched the corresponding miRNAs closely in all sequence properties that impact the expected number and quality of TargetScan target sites. The properties we considered were (1) the expected frequency of seed matches in the UTR dataset; (2) the expected frequency of matching to the 3' end of the miRNA; (3) the observed count of seed matches in the UTR dataset; and (4) the predicted free energy of a seed:seed match duplex ...
