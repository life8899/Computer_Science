In these cases, the miRNAs were usually, but not always, from the same paralogous miRNA family, often with the same seed heptamer. In those cases where the same UTR was hit by multiple miRNAs from different families (54 genes), the target sites generally did not overlap, consistent with simultaneous binding and regulation of some target genes by combinations of miRNAs ... Predicted miRNA targets populated many major GO functional categories, and for each of these categories, the number of targets for the real miRNAs greatly exceeded the average for the shuffled cohorts.

For example, when compared to the seeds of shuffled cohorts that had not been screened to control for the expected number of target sites and the expected strength of miRNA:target site interactions, the seeds of vertebrate miRNAs have approximately 1.4 times as many seed matches in vertebrate UTRs. Specifically, the seeds of vertebrate miRNAs each had an average of about 2100 perfect-complement matches in masked vertebrate UTR regions whereas random heptamers with the same base composition averaged only about 1500 matches ... A miRNA shuffling protocol, MiRshuffle, was developed to generate randomized control sequences that possess all of these properties. For a given miRNA sequence, MiRshuffle generates a series of random permutations with the same length and base composition as the miRNA, until a shuffled sequence is found that matches the parent miRNA closely in each of the four criteria listed above. The MiRshuffle procedure calculated expected frequencies using a first-order Markov model of 3' UTR composition that accounts for the long-recognized impact of dinucleotide frequency biases on the counts of longer oligonucleotides (Nussinov, 1981). As an additional control, another shuffling protocol was developed, DiMiRshuffle, which preserves the precise dinucleotide composition of both the seed and the 3' end of the miRNA, as well as the seed match count and seed:seed match folding free energy ... To assess target gene functions, we evaluated the frequency of specific gene ontology (GO) molecular function classifications (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2001) among the predicted targets of the nrMamm miRNAs and their shuffled control sequences (Table 2) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |
