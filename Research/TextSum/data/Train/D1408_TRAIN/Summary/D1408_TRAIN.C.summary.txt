MicroRNA genes are one of the most abundant classes of genes in mammals known to regulate many functions during development and other processes. However, all the miRNAs regulated by the vertebrates are still not known and efforts to generate more sophisticated methods for predicting targets are on the run. Lewis et al., 2003 report here a study to identify hundreds of mammalian miRNA targets using a computational and experimental approach called TargetScan. The main highlight of this paper is that the authors developed an algorithm based modeling to identify the targets of vertebrate miRNAs, which is the main citation in most of the papers. Using this system they identified more than 400 regulatory target genes with conserved pairing to 5’ region of the miRNA since this portion particularly nucleotides 2-8 are believed to be the most crucial region for target recognitions in mammalian microRNAs. The number and quality of the complementary sites of these targets was evaluated and confirmed using complex tests using shuffled miRNA controls. Out of all the identified targets, 11 were tested and confirmed using HeLa cell line reporter system. These mammalian miRNA targets displayed diverse functions and mostly enriched with those involved in transcriptional regulation. Altogether, this study provides an efficient tool for identifying miRNA targets and provides evidence of their diverse regulatory network.
