	Campbell et al., 2007 describes the analysis of microarray datasets produced from various murine tissues in order to gain insight into Oct4 transcriptional networks during stem cell differentiation and to identify genes that are co-regulated with Oct4. The samples chosen were produced from a variety of samples ranging from adult and embryonic stem cells and a variety of their differentiated derivatives including hematopoietic, muscle, and neuronal cells.  By examining which genes were co-regulated with Oct4 the study aims to identify candidates that are direct targets of Oct4 regulation as well as genes that are central to stem cell identity and differentiation.  From the analysis 1155 upregulated genes and 69 downregulated genes were identified. Among the genes identified the authors identified Oct4 binding sites in the promoter or downstream of the gene in 392 candidates. The authors then confirmed 28 of these candidates as direct targets of Oct4 regulation through ChIP assays, demonstrating the value of their co-regulation analysis.  Genes that are co-regulated with Oct4 fall into a number of categories including chromatin regulation, cell cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis, and nuclear architecture. These categories of genes broaden the understanding of Oct4's function and provide insight into its central role in pluripotentcy, self-renewal, and differentiation. Oct4 expression is common in human cancers and knowledge of its normal role in development will provide insight into disease states. The study provides a valuable dataset to identify relationships in the Oct4 transcriptional network and to identify candidate genes for further study in stem cell biology.
