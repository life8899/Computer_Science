Hanaban et al 2000 discuss the concept of tumorigenesis in humans cancer as a manifestation of six essential physiologic cell changes that together dictate malignant growth. These six capabilities, described as the hallmark of cancer, are found in virtually all cancers. The characteristics are self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to growth-inhibitory (antigrowth) signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion and metastasis.Although virtually all cancers share these hallmarks, their means of doing so will vary significantly, both mechanistically and chronologically. These novel capabilities acquired during tumor development represent the successful breaching of an anticancer defense mechanism hardwired into cells.The concept of a hallmark of cancer builds on a previous understanding of tumorigenesis in humans as a multistep process, with genetic alterations that progressively transform normal human cells into highly malignant derivatives. The role of oncogenes in tumorigenesis has been studied, for example it has been shown that loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor can facilitate both angiogenesis and resistance to apoptosis as well as enabling the characteristic of genomic instability. Tumors are shown to be complex multicellular enterprises, with their microenvironment playing a role in the transformation to the tumor phenotype and normal cells conscripted to enhance tumor growth. It is suspected that many of the growth signals driving the proliferation of carcinoma cells originate from the stromal cell components of the tumor mass. Further, inflammatory cells attracted to sites of neoplasia may actually promote, rather than eliminate cancer cells.
