	Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000 review the current state of cancer research as well as discuss future directions for the field. The authors emphasize the six “hallmarks of cancer,” biological traits that  diverse types of cancers have in common: (1) self-sufficiency in growth signals, (2) insensitivity to antigrowth signals, (3) evasion of apoptosis, (4) limitless replicative potential, (5) sustained angiogenesis, and (6) tissue invasion and metastasis. For tumor progression the above traits must all be met in some way. The authors emphasize the multistep nature of tumor progression which proceeds through the accumulation of various genetic alterations allowing tumor cells to adapt, proliferate, and metastasize. They also illustrate diverse examples of tumor strategies for achieving the each of the hallmark characteristics of cancer. The article proposes that the key to understanding and treating diverse cancers is to understand their defining characteristics and commonalities rather than focus on specific and unique biochemical properties. By understanding the hallmarks of cancer rational drug design targeting essential cancer properties such as angiogenesis or evasion of apoptosis can be devised.  Additionally authors emphasize the complex heterotypic nature of tumors and tumor microenvironments which has been an obstacle to research. The authors look forward to future studies and techniques allowing a more comprehensive understanding of cancer biology in “heterotypic organ culture systems in vitro and evermore refined mouse models in vivo.” Overall the review offers an excellent summary of current knowledge of cancer biology and proposes a framework to understand a diverse field and guide further study.
