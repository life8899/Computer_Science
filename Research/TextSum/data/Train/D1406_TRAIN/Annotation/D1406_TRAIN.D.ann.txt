Heterotypic signaling between the diverse cell types within a tumor may ultimately prove to be as important in explaining tumor cell proliferation as the cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms enumerated above. For example, we suspect that many of the growth signals driving the proliferation of carcinoma cells originate from the stromal cell components of the tumor mass ... Further, inflammatory cells attracted to sites of neoplasia may promote (rather than eliminate) cancer cells (18, 22 and 46), another example of normal cells conscripted to enhance tumor growth potential, another means to acquire necessary capabilities | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |

At the mechanistic level, they are closely allied processes, which justifies their association with one another as one general capability of cancer cells. Both utilize similar operational strategies, involving changes in the physical coupling of cells to their microenvironment and activation of extracellular proteases ... Changes in integrin expression are also evident in invasive and metastatic cells. Invading and metastasizing cancer cells experience changing tissue microenvironments during their journeys, which can present novel matrix components ...

We suggest that the vast catalog of cancer cell genotypes is a manifestation of six essential alterations in cell physiology that collectively dictate malignant growth (Figure 1): self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to growth-inhibitory (antigrowth) signals, evasion of programmed cell death (apoptosis), limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion and metastasis ...

It is, however, increasingly apparent that the growth deregulation within a tumor can only be explained once we understand the contributions of the ancillary cells present in a tumor—the apparently normal bystanders such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells—which must play key roles in driving tumor cell proliferation (Figure 3, right panel) ...

Telomere maintenance is evident in virtually all types of malignant cells (Shay and Bacchetti 1997); 85%–90% of them succeed in doing so by upregulating expression of the telomerase enzyme, which adds hexanucleotide repeats onto the ends of telomeric DNA (Bryan and Cech 1999), while the remainder have invented a way of activating a mechanism, termed ALT, which appears to maintain telomeres through recombination-based interchromosomal exchanges of sequence information (Bryan et al. 1995) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  D, |
