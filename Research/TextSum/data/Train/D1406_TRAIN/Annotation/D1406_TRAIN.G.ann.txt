Additionally, the PI3 kinase–AKT/PKB pathway, which transmits antiapoptotic survival signals, is likely involved in mitigating apoptosis in a substantial fraction of human tumors ... The activation of extracellular proteases and the altered binding specificities of cadherins, CAMs, and integrins are clearly central to the acquisition of invasiveness and metastatic ability | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

Like the formation of the primary tumor mass, successful invasion and metastasis depend upon all of the other five acquired hallmark capabilities ... Nonetheless, we believe that independent of how the steps in these genetic pathways are arranged, the biological endpoints that are ultimately reached—the hallmark capabilities of cancer—will prove to be shared in common by all types of tumors | Discourse Facet:  Hypothesis_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

Taken together, observations of human cancers and animal models argue that tumor development proceeds via a process formally analogous to Darwinian evolution, in which a succession of genetic changes, each conferring one or another type of growth advantage, leads to the progressive conversion of normal human cells into cancer cells ( 33 and 71) | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  G, |
