Taken together, observations of human cancers and animal models argue that tumor development proceeds via a process formally analogous to Darwinian evolution, in which a succession of genetic changes, each conferring one or another type of growth advantage, leads to the progressive conversion of normal human cells into cancer cells ( 33 and 71) ... While difficult to validate at present, such thinking recasts the logic of acquired GS autonomy: successful tumor cells are those that have acquired the ability to co-opt their normal neighbors by inducing them to release abundant fluxes of growth-stimulating signals (Skobe and Fusenig 1998). Indeed, in some tumors, these cooperating cells may eventually depart from normalcy, coevolving with their malignant neighbors in order to sustain the growth of the latter (58 and 72). Further, inflammatory cells attracted to sites of neoplasia may promote (rather than eliminate) cancer cells (18, 22 and 46), another example of normal cells conscripted to enhance tumor growth potential, another means to acquire necessary capabilities | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

This redundancy holds important implications for the development of novel types of antitumor therapy, since tumor cells that have lost proapoptotic components are likely to retain other similar ones. We anticipate that new technologies will be able to display the apoptotic pathways still operative in specific types of cancer cells and that new drugs will enable cross-talk between the still intact components of parallel apoptotic signaling pathways in tumor cells, resulting in restoration of the apoptotic defense mechanism, with substantial therapeutic benefit ... We envision that evolving analytic techniques will soon make it possible to construct comprehensive profiles of the expression and functional activities of proteases, integrins, and CAMs in a wide variety of cancer types, both before and after they acquire invasive and metastatic abilities. The challenge will then be to apply the new molecular insights about tissue invasiveness and metastasis to the development of effective therapeutic strategies ... This reconceptualization of cancer cell biology has begun to drive profound changes in how we study this disease experimentally. Continuing elucidation of cancer pathogenesis will depend increasingly upon heterotypic organ culture systems in vitro and evermore refined mouse models in vivo. Looking ahead into the future, these systems will help us chart comprehensive maps of growth signaling networks in cancer, an endeavor that will depend on defining all of the signals exchanged between the various cell types existing symbiotically within a tumor mass and knowing their effects on the integrated circuits of each of those cell types | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

Resistance to apoptosis can be acquired by cancer cells through a variety of strategies. Surely, the most commonly occurring loss of a proapoptotic regulator through mutation involves the p53 tumor suppressor gene. The resulting functional inactivation of its product, the p53 protein, is seen in greater than 50% of human cancers and results in the removal of a key component of the DNA damage sensor that can induce the apoptotic effector cascade ( Harris 1996) ... The most prominent member of these systems is the p53 tumor suppressor protein, which, in response to DNA damage, elicits either cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair to take place or apoptosis if the damage is excessive. Indeed, it is now clear that the functioning of the p53 DNA damage signaling pathway is lost in most, if not all, human cancers (Levine 1997) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

The SOS-Ras-Raf-MAPK cascade plays a central role here ... New downstream effector pathways that radiate from the central SOS-Ras-Raf-MAP kinase mitogenic cascade are being discovered with some regularity (48 and 77). This cascade is also linked via a variety of cross-talking connections with other pathways; these cross connections enable extracellular signals to elicit multiple cell biological effects. For example, the direct interaction of the Ras protein with the survival-promoting PI3 kinase enables growth signals to concurrently evoke survival signals within the cell (Downward 1998) ... Additionally, the PI3 kinase–AKT/PKB pathway, which transmits antiapoptotic survival signals, is likely involved in mitigating apoptosis in a substantial fraction of human tumors.

A further dimension of complexity derives from the multiple cell types involved in protease expression and display. In many types of carcinomas, matrix-degrading proteases are produced not by the epithelial cancer cells but rather by conscripted stromal and inflammatory cells (Werb 1997); once released by these cells, they may be wielded by the carcinoma cells ... Further, mutations in certain oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can occur early in some tumor progression pathways and late in others. As a consequence, the acquisition of biological capabilities such as resistance to apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis, and unlimited replicative potential can appear at different times during these various progressions. Accordingly, the particular sequence in which capabilities are acquired can vary widely, both among tumors of the same type and certainly between tumors of different types ( Figure 4) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

The role of telomerase in immortalizing cells can be demonstrated directly by ectopically expressing the enzyme in cells, where it can convey unlimited replicative potential onto a variety of normal early passage, presenescent cells in vitro (7 and 92). Further, late passage cells poised to enter crisis continue to proliferate without giving any evidence of crisis when supplied with this enzyme (20, 40 and 101) ... The above-cited observations might argue that senescence, much like apoptosis, reflects a protective mechanism that can be activated by shortened telomeres or conflicting growth signals that forces aberrant cells irreversibly into a G0-like state, thereby rendering them incapable of further proliferation | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  C, |

When coexpressed with a myc oncogene in transgenic mice, the bcl-2 gene was able to promote formation of B cell lymphomas by enhancing lymphocyte survival, not by further stimulating their myc-induced proliferation ( Strasser et al. 1990); further, 50% of the infrequent lymphomas arising in bcl-2 single transgenic transgenic mice had somatic translocations activating c-myc, confirming a selective pressure during lymphomagenesis to upregulate both Bcl-2 and c-Myc ( McDonnell and Korsmeyer 1991) ...

The ability of tumor cell populations to expand in number is determined not only by the rate of cell proliferation but also by the rate of cell attrition. Programmed cell death—apoptosis—represents a major source of this attrition.
