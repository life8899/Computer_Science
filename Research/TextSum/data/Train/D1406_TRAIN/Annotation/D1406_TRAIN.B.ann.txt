Within normal tissue, cells are largely instructed to grow by their neighbors (paracrine signals) or via systemic (endocrine) signals. Cell-to-cell growth signaling is likely to operate in the vast majority of human tumors as well; virtually all are composed of several distinct cell types that appear to communicate via heterotypic signaling ... Heterotypic signaling between the diverse cell types within a tumor may ultimately prove to be as important in explaining tumor cell proliferation as the cancer cell-autonomous mechanisms enumerated above. For example, we suspect that many of the growth signals driving the proliferation of carcinoma cells originate from the stromal cell components of the tumor mass. While difficult to validate at present, such thinking recasts the logic of acquired GS autonomy: successful tumor cells are those that have acquired the ability to co-opt their normal neighbors by inducing them to release abundant fluxes of growth-stimulating signals (Skobe and Fusenig 1998). Indeed, in some tumors, these cooperating cells may eventually depart from normalcy, coevolving with their malignant neighbors in order to sustain the growth of the latter (58 and 72). Further, inflammatory cells attracted to sites of neoplasia may promote (rather than eliminate) cancer cells (18, 22 and 46), another example of normal cells conscripted to enhance tumor growth potential, another means to acquire necessary capabilities ... cancer development depends upon changes in the heterotypic interactions between incipient tumor cells and their normal neighbors. Moreover, once formed, virtually all types of human tumors, including their metastatic outgrowths, continue to harbor complex mixtures of several cell types that collaborate to create malignant growth (Figure 3) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

Each of these physiologic changes—novel capabilities acquired during tumor development—represents the successful breaching of an anticancer defense mechanism hardwired into cells and tissues ... The paths that cells take on their way to becoming malignant are highly variable. Within a given cancer type, mutation of particular target genes such as ras or p53 may be found in only a subset of otherwise histologically identical tumors. Further, mutations in certain oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can occur early in some tumor progression pathways and late in others. As a consequence, the acquisition of biological capabilities such as resistance to apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis, and unlimited replicative potential can appear at different times during these various progressions. Accordingly, the particular sequence in which capabilities are acquired can vary widely, both among tumors of the same type and certainly between tumors of different types ( Figure 4). Furthermore, in certain tumors, a specific genetic event may, on its own, contribute only partially to the acquisition of a single capability, while in others, this event may aid in the simultaneous acquisition of several distinct capabilities. Nonetheless, we believe that independent of how the steps in these genetic pathways are arranged, the biological endpoints that are ultimately reached—the hallmark capabilities of cancer—will prove to be shared in common by all types of tumors | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |
