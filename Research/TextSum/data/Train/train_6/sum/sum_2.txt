More than two decades of research has revealed that cancer is a disease involving genetic mutations and is affected by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes expression. This review by Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000 discusses the basics of transformation of normal cells into malignant cancers. There are several reports stating that tumor is a multistep process and derived through a series of genetic changes each of which eventually leads to the conversion of normal cells to cancerous. Here, the authors focus on the cell physiology of cancers and how the tumors are formed.  They report self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and tissue invasion and metastasis as the six hallmarks of cancer. Elaborated description of deregulations in growth signaling and apoptosis inducing pathways to acquire capability of limitless replicative potential by cancer cells is presented here. Even though the biology of tumor formation is complex, this review describes in detail the hallmark capabilities of cancer that are proven to be shared in common by all types of tumors and will help in the development of better therapeutic strategies.
