The manuscript by Hanahan and Weinberg is a review that describes the cellular and phenotypic hallmarks of cancer as a multi-stage and multi-cell process. Six hallmarks of cancer were described: self-sufficiency in growth signals, evading apoptosis, insensitivity to anti-grown signals, sustained angiogenesis, limitless replicative potential, and tissue invasion and metastasis. Most citing manuscripts referred to the implications and hypotheses of this manuscript, including cancer is a multi-stage and multi-cell process, genetic and epigenetic changes are essential in neoplastic development and tumorgenesis, and the six hallmarks of cancer (i.e. invasiveness, cell proliferation, etc.). One manuscript used a result from this review that was discussed to make the hypothesis that upregulation of proinflammatory genes in hemangiocarcinoma could result from selective pressures to create a favorable microenvironment for tumor growth. One manuscript used this reference paper to note what was not discussed as only few studies focus on the role of tumor microenvironment on chemotherapy. Another manuscript stated that their rationale for using phenotype as an experimental outcome was because Hanahan and Weinberg focused on the importance of phenotypic changes of cancer. Only one citing manuscript referred to a result in this paper, which included mutations in RAS and PIK activates the anti-apoptosis survival pathway and p53 mutation results in removal of a key component in DNA damage, inducing apoptosis. The impact of this manuscript is that is presents a new perspective on cancer as a multi-stage and multi-cell process wherein normal cells are conscripted by transformed cancer cells, contributing to the phenotype.
