Sherr et al 2002 discuss the interconnecting signaling pathways controlled by the retinoblastoma protein, RB and the p53 transcription factor. These major tumor suppressor are prominent among the regulators disrupted in cancer cells.Tumorigenesis involves a multistep process with genetic changes disrupting normal growth control or overriding the cell cycle checkpoints that limit cell division or induce cell apoptosis. The binding of RB to E2F transcription factors plays a central role in DNA replication and is associated with RB`s function as a tumor suppressor. Mutation of RB is thought to play a causative role in most human cancers. RB is functionally inactivated either by direct mutation/deletion or indirectly through altered expression/activity of upstream regulators. The INK4 proteins, including p16INK4A, act as upstream regulators, inhibiting the activity of cyclin D-dependent kinases, thus preventing phosphorylation of RB, and preventing S phase entry. Mutations inactivating p16INKA have been discovered in many cancers along with over expression of cyclin D1 or CDK4. These mutations are thought to act in a mutually exclusive manner.The p53 pathway is inactivated in nearly all human tumors, either through direct mutation of p53 or the loss of upstream regulators such as ARF.Deregulation of E2F induces Arf transcription and therefore p53 showing an interconnection between p53 and the RB.Altogether, this paper gives a detailed insight into the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression through inactivation of RB and p53 functions, providing a rational basis for the development of more refined tumor-specific therapies.
