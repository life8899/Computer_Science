It has been reported that micro RNAs (miRNAs) contribute to a variety of cell functions and are involved in the development of human cancer. Accordingly, in the manuscript, Wang et al., authors analyzed the subset of miRNA, and found that miRNAs are significantly deregulated in cervical cancer as authors applied various approaches to profile miRNA expression from cervical cancer tissues, cervical cancer-derived cell lines and HPV-infected vaginal keratinocytes. Using miRNA array analysis, authors identified that miR-126, miR-143, miR-145 significantly down-regulated, while miR-15b, miR-16, miR-146a and miR-155 up-regulated in cervical cancer tissue.  The results and discussion has been cited by several manuscript e.g.  expression of miR-146 has been found to be up-regulated in cervical cancer, functional studies showed that when cells were infected with miR-146a for the overexpression of miR-146a, cells proliferate more as cells doubling time 2-3 hrs faster than that of the cells with miR control, this suggests that miR-146 works as an oncogenic  miRNA in cervical cancer.  As reference paper identified that HeLa and CaSki cells showed high expression of miR-21, thus Xie et al., used these two cells as an internal control to evaluate the enrichment of miRNA after CLIP. However, article by Patron et al., cited this paper for the expression of miR-133b in the tumor tissue, while reference paper did not mention miR-133b expression.  Major implication of this study is that miRNA- 146a expression is cervical cancer specific as its expression was down regulated in normal tissue and in HPV-infected raft tissue with pre-neoplastic lesions.
