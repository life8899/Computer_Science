However, downregulation of miR-146a was noticed in the raft cultures rather than the upregulation seen in cervical cancer tissues and was further confirmed by northern blotting (Fig. 5), indicating that the upregulation of miR-146a expression is cervical cancer-specific | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  G, |
