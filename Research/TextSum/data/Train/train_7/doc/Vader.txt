Abstract
The Aurora protein kinase family (consisting of Aurora-A, -B and -C) is an important group of enzymes that controls several aspects of cell division in mammalian cells. Dysfunction of these kinases has been associated with a failure to maintain a stable chromosome content, a state that can contribute to tumourigenesis. Additionally, Aurora-A is frequently found amplified in a variety of tumour types and displays oncogenic activity. On the other hand, therapeutic inhibition of these kinases has shown great promise as potential anti-cancer treatment, most likely because of their essential roles during cell division. This review will focus on our present understanding of the different roles played by these kinases, their regulation throughout cell division, their deregulation in human cancers and on the progress that is made in targeting these important regulators in the treatment of cancer.

1. Introduction
The process of cell division has to occur at high fidelity to maintain a stable diploid chromosome content in the progeny. Mitosis is the final phase of the cell cycle, during which the physical segregation of the duplicated genome into two daughter cells takes place [1]. Prior to mitosis, the duplicated centrosomes mature in G2. In prophase, the chromosomes condense; the matured centrosomes separate and display increased microtubule nucleation, resulting in the formation of the bipolar mitotic spindle. During prometaphase, after breakdown of the nuclear envelope, the two kinetochores of paired sister chromatids are captured by the mitotic spindle, ultimately resulting in the alignment of all chromatid pairs at the cell's equator. In metaphase, several important mitotic regulators are degraded, which is required for the onset of anaphase during which the paired sister chromatids will segregate to opposite sites of the cell by the action of the mitotic spindle. In telophase, the chromatids decondense and the nuclear envelope reforms, resulting in the formation of two new daughter nuclei. Finally, during cytokinesis, the cytoplasm of the mother cell is divided yielding two separated daughter cells with an exact copy of their mother's genetic content (Fig. 1). Errors during the segregation of the chromosomes will yield daughter cells with chromosome numbers above or below the normal amount (46 in humans), a state called aneuploidy. Failure to execute cytokinesis will result in a single daughter cell with a tetraploid chromosome content (i.e. twice the normal chromosome content).

DNA is in blue, Aurora-A/B in red and α-tubulin in green. Aurora-B shows the typical chromosomal passenger localisation. Early in mitosis it localises at the centromeres and the chromosome arms. During prometaphase it further concentrates at the centromeres. During anaphase, Aurora-B transfers to the central spindle and the cell cortex. During telophase and cytokinesis, Aurora-B concentrates at the midbody at the presumptive cleavage furrow. Note that the described localisation of Aurora-C is identical to that of Aurora-B.

The progression and execution of mitosis is under heavy posttranslational control by several protein kinases. Cyclin-B/Cdk-1 activity is the driving force that promotes mitotic entry and proper mitotic progression. Several other kinases like the Plks [2], the NIMA kinases [3] and the Aurora kinases play essential roles during mitosis. This review will focus on the Aurora kinase family, members of which control processes ranging from centrosome function to chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. On a cellular level, dysfunction of these kinases can result in aneuploidy and/or tetraploidy, and misregulation of these kinases has been associated with tumourigenesis.

2. Aurora kinases
Mammalian genomes contain three genes encoding Aurora kinases, denoted Aurora-A, Aurora-B, Aurora-C. The three Aurora kinases are serine–threonine protein kinases that together form a small kinase family phylogenetically related to the branch of the AGC (protein kinase A/protein kinase G/protein kinase C-family) protein kinases [4]. The founding member of the Aurora kinases is the Drosophila Aurora kinase that was discovered in a screen to identify genes involved in mitotic spindle function [5]. Fungi have only one Aurora kinase (Ipl1 in S. cerevisiae [6] and [7] and Ark1 in S. pombe [8]) that is functionally more related to the Aurora-B kinases in higher organisms. Mammals have a third Aurora gene called Aurora-C. Aurora kinase function is controlled by several mechanisms. Firstly, gene transcription of the Aurora kinases is cell cycle regulated. The promoters of Aurora-B and Aurora-A contain specific sequences (CDE/CHR sequences) required for transcription in G2 [9], [10] and [11]. Several transcription factors, such as E2F-1, E2F-4, DP-2 and FoxM1 have been implicated in cell cycle regulated transcription of Aurora-B G2 [9], [10], [11] and [12]. The Aurora-C gene seems to be mainly expressed in meiotically dividing cells, and its transcription is at least in part controlled by a testis-specific transcription factor called Testis Zinc Finger Protein (Tzfp) [13].

3. Regulation by activation and localisation
Structurally, the Aurora kinases are closely related to the family of AGC kinases. The AGC kinases are activated through an intramolecular interaction between two distinct, highly conserved sequences. Folding of a COOH-terminal sequence in a hydrophobic motif pocket is required for full kinase activation and some of the AGC kinases require phosphorylation within this pocket for activation [4]. However, the Aurora kinases lack the typical COOH-terminal motif, but they are still activated in a similar molecular manner, albeit with the help of interacting cofactors that contain these critical motifs. Several cofactors have been described for the Aurora kinases that are needed for proper activation and function.

3.1. Aurora-A
For Aurora-A, the best characterised cofactor is TPX2. TPX2 was initially identified as a microtubule-associated protein required for bipolar spindle assembly [14] and it was later shown to bind and target Aurora-A to the mitotic spindle, but not to the centrosomes [15]. TPX2–Aurora-A binding is promoted by an active Ran-GTP signalling pathway (see below). TPX2 binds to Aurora-A through its conserved NH2-terminal domain, and this induces the activation segment of Aurora-A to move inside the catalytic pocket of the kinase [16] and [17]. By doing so, TPX2 also protects a crucial phospho-threonine (threonine 288 in human Aurora-A) in the activation segment within the protein against protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1)-dependent dephosphorylation and inactivation of Aurora-A [16] and [17]. Remarkably, the mode of binding between TPX2 and Aurora-A and the conformational changes that are induced in Aurora-A upon binding bear resemblance to the mode of intramolecular binding and activation of cAMP-dependent kinase [16]. In vivo, activation of Aurora-A synergistically depends on (auto)phosphorylation within its activation segment (on threonine 288) and TPX2 binding, potentially in combination with microtubule-binding [18].

In addition to TPX2, Aurora-A is known to bind to several other proteins implicated in its activation and localisation. First, Aurora-A binds to, and phosphorylates Ajuba, a protein that localises to the centrosome and is required for Aurora-A autophosphorylation [19]. As such, Ajuba is required for the initial centrosomal activation of Aurora-A during late G2 through its interaction with the NH2-terminal region of Aurora-A. This is in contrast with TPX2 that interacts with the COOH-terminal catalytic domain of Aurora-A [19]. It is at present unclear by which molecular mechanism Ajuba activates Aurora-A. Second, Aurora-A was recently described to bind to a conserved protein that was named Bora [20]. Bora was identified in a Drosophila screen for mutants with impaired asymmetric cell division, a phenotype that also manifests in certain Aurora-A mutants [21]. Aurora-A was found to bind and phosphorylate Bora and addition of Bora to Aurora-A enhanced its kinase activity in vitro [20]. Bora does not seem to localise to the centrosome and instead is released from the nucleus into the cytoplasm in late G2 in a Cdk1-dependent manner [20]. Third, Aurora-A can bind to, and is activated by HEF1, a well-characterised protein with a role in focal adhesion [22]. Fourth, a protein called Inhibitor-2, previously identified as an inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1, was shown to directly bind and allosterically stimulate Aurora-A activity [23]. In summary, it seems that different proteins play a role in Aurora-A activation, but it is unclear how these different activators relate to each other and how these different signals are integrated during cell cycle progression. It is possible that different proteins are required for activation of Aurora-A at different times and cellular locations throughout the cell cycle or that they provide specificity for certain Aurora-A substrates (see below).

3.2. Aurora-B
Autophosphorylation of Aurora-B within its activation segment occurs on threonine 232 in human Aurora-B. Full activation of Aurora-B requires this autophosphorylation and binding to INCENP. Aurora-B interacts with the conserved IN-box within the COOH-terminus of INCENP and this binding causes partial activation of Aurora-B [24]. The IN-box allosterically induces changes in the activation loop of Aurora-B that are similar to the changes induced by TPX2 on Aurora-A, although the mode of binding of INCENP to Aurora-B is different from that of TPX2 binding to Aurora-A [24]. Furthermore, full activity of Aurora-B is only achieved after phosphorylation of a TSS motif within INCENP that lies adjacent to the IN-box. Possibly, this autophosphorylation induces a further conformational change within the catalytic pocket of Aurora-B that is required for full activity. Phosphorylation of the TSS motif likely occurs in trans in which one Aurora-B molecule phosphorylates INCENP bound to a neighbouring Aurora-B molecule [24], explaining how local concentration of Aurora-B on chromatin can enhance the activity of the total Aurora-B pool in vivo [25]. Besides its direct interaction with INCENP, Aurora-B is known to reside in a multi-protein chromosomal passenger complex together with Survivin and Borealin, required for efficient localisation of Aurora-B during mitosis [26]. Recently, several kinases, such as Mps1, Chkl, and Tousled-like kinase-1, were shown to be involved in proper activation of Aurora-B. The checkpoint kinase Mps1 phosphorylates the CPC subunit Borealin, and this event is required for full Aurora-B activation [27]. Chk1 was shown to directly phosphorylate and activate Aurora-B [28], whereas C. elegans Tousled-like kinase was shown to activate Aurora-B in a kinase activity-independent, but INCENP-dependent manner [29] and [30]. Additionally, TD-60, a protein long known for its chromosomal passenger-like mitotic localisation, was recently shown to be required for both centromeric localisation and activation of Aurora-B [31]. Taken together, similar to Aurora-A, also Aurora-B requires additional cofactors that control its activity, proper localisation and substrate specificity.

3.3. Aurora-C
Aurora-C, like Aurora-B, is capable of binding to the IN-box of INCENP. This binding also results in activation of Aurora-C, in a manner that is most likely similar to the mode of activation of Aurora-B [32] and [33]. Until now it is not known what the exact requirements are for full Aurora-C activation in vivo.

4. Regulation by degradation
Both Aurora-A and Aurora-B are targets of a multi-subunit E3-ubiquitin ligase called the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) [34], [35], [36], [37], [38] and [39]. The APC/C, in conjunction with its specificity factor Cdh1, targets these proteins for destruction during mitotic exit and as such ensures that G1 cells contain low levels of these proteins. The cellular consequences of misregulated degradation of the Aurora kinases are unknown, although non-degradable Aurora-B was shown to be more potent in promoting anchorage-independent growth than wild type Aurora-B [35]. Besides the APC/C, also a Cullin 3(Cul3)-based E3 ligase was shown to ubiquitinate Aurora-B in vitro and in vivo [40]. Ubiquitination was shown to promote dissociation of Aurora-B from metaphase chromosomes, and recent data indicate that degradation-independent ubiquitination of Aurora-B triggers Cdc48/p97 ATPase-dependent extraction of Aurora-B from mitotic chromosomes, an event required for timely chromosome decondensation during mitotic exit. In addition, removal of Aurora-B from mitotic chromosomes is required for nuclear membrane assembly in telophase [41].

5. Functions of the different Aurora kinases
5.1. Aurora-A
5.1.1. Centrosome maturation
During G2, several proteins accumulate at the centrosome that causes growth of the pericentrosomal material (PCM) and contribute to increased centrosomal microtubule nucleation activity. Collectively, this process is often referred to as centrosome maturation. In line with the identification of Aurora mutants (that turned out to be mutations in the Aurora-A gene) in a screen for bipolar spindle assembly defects in Drosophila melanogaster [5], the functions of Aurora-A are mainly related to centrosome function and bipolar spindle assembly. Aurora-A localises to the centrosomes in G2 and mitosis and is also present on the mitotic spindle in mitosis ( Fig. 1b). Centrosomal targeting of Aurora-A requires several centrosomal protein kinases, such as Pak1 [42], Plk-1 [43] and Cdk-11 [44]. Of these, Pak1 directly binds and phosphorylates Aurora-A [42]. In several model systems, Aurora-A depletion causes defects in centrosome maturation in G2 and microtubule nucleation in mitosis. Aurora-A is required for the correct localisation and function of centrosomal components like centrosomin [45], NDEL1 [46], LATS [47] and [48] and TACC proteins [49] and [50]. Some of these proteins are to thought drive centrosome maturation (e.g. centrosomin), whereas others are thought to specifically promote microtubule nucleation. For example, phosphorylation of TACC in Drosophila at centrosomes is required for the proper association of the minus-end of the microtubule with the centrosome [49].

5.1.2. Centrosome separation and bipolar spindle assembly
After maturation, the centrosomes migrate apart during late G2 to define the two poles of the bipolar mitotic spindle, and this event also requires Aurora-A function. Inhibition or depletion of Aurora-A causes monopolar spindles in several model systems [5], [51], [52] and [53]. Aurora-A was reported to phosphorylate Eg5, a conserved BimC-like kinesin involved in centrosome separation, but it is not established whether this phosphorylation influences bipolarity [54]. Furthermore, Aurora-A is known to affect the presence of astral microtubules [50]. Astral microtubules connect the centrosomes with the cell cortex, and these connections can influence spindle bipolarity and (a)symmetric divisions during development. Although formation of a bipolar mitotic spindle is mainly driven by microtubule nucleation at the centrosomes, chromosomes also play a role in bipolar spindle formation, even in centrosome-containing cells [55] and [56]. During mitosis, the GTPase Ran is converted into Ran-GTP in the vicinity of chromosomes, via RCC1, its GEF that is bound to chromosomes [57] and [58]. This creates a gradient of active Ran-GTP around mitotic chromosomes [59], [60] and [61]. Ran-GTP subsequently binds importin-β causing the release of important microtubule-assembly factors like TPX2, Numa, NUSAP and Rae1 near chromosomes [62], [63], [64], [65], [66] and [67]. In the presence of exogenous Ran-GTP, beads coated with Aurora-A are capable of driving bipolar spindle assembly in Xenopus extracts devoid of centrosomes and chromatin but in a TPX2 and γ-tubulin-dependent fashion [18], suggesting that Aurora-A activity is a critical driving force for spindle assembly. Recently, Aurora-A was found to reside in a large multi-protein complex on the mitotic spindle consisting of Aurora-A, TPX2, Eg5, the microtubule-stabilising protein XMAP125/chTOG and the MT-binding protein HURP [68]. Aurora-A kinase activity promotes assembly of this complex, that might be responsible for chromatin-driven bipolar spindle assembly.

5.1.3. Mitotic entry and cell cycle regulation
Several studies have shown that Aurora-A plays a role in promoting timely mitotic entry by controlling initial centrosomal activation of Cyclin-B/Cdk-1 [19] and [69]. Recently, it was shown that Aurora-A promotes the G2-activation of Polo-like kinase-1 (Plk-1) through direct phosphorylation within the T-loop of Plk-1 [70] and [71]. Interestingly, this phosphorylation specifically requires the Aurora-A cofactor Bora (and does not, for example depend on other cofactors such as TPX2 [70]). Active Plk1 controls Cyclin-B/Cdk1 activity through phosphorylation of the Cdc25B phosphatase and degradation of the Cdk1 inhibitory kinase Wee1 [72] and [73]. Additionally, Aurora-A also directly phosphorylates and promotes the activation of the Cdc25B phosphatase at centrosomes [74]. Since Cdc25B is required for initial centrosomal activation of Cyclin-B/Cdk-1 during the G2/M transition [75], this suggests that Aurora-A might feed into this process through Cdc25B.

Besides being important centres for cell cycle cues and spindle formation, centrosomes can also induce the formation of tail-like protrusions called cilia that act as sensors of environmental cues that control cell signalling [76]. Dysfunction of cilia has been associated with several diseases and could play a role during tumour development. Cilia (dis)assembly is cell cycle regulated, and Aurora-A, together with its binding protein HEF1 influences cilia function by triggering cilia disassembly during cell cycle progression [77].

5.2. Aurora-B
5.2.1. Chromosome condensation
Condensation of chromosomes into compact structures is essential for error-free sister chromatid segregation and is driven by the action of Condensin complexes (Condensin I and II in human cells) [78] and [79]. Aurora-B contributes to proper condensation and chromosomal association of the Condensin I complex in several organisms, potentially via direct phosphorylation of the three non-SMC subunits [80], [81], [82], [83], [84] and [85]. It must be noted that Condensin loading and condensation show a different dependency on Aurora-B in different organisms [80], [81], [82], [83], [84] and [86]. Phosphorylation of Histone H3 at serine-10 during late G2/prophase by Aurora-B has also been linked with chromosome condensation, also because mutation of this phosphorylation-site in Tetrahymena thermophila and S. pombe caused chromosome condensation and subsequent segregation defects [80], [87], [88], [89] and [90]. However, a similar mutation did not cause any mitotic defects in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae [88]. These differences might be explained by differences in chromosome structure between these species. In human cells, phosphorylation of serine-10 Histone H3 was suggested to displace the HP-1 family of proteins from heterochromatin in mitosis [91] and [92], but whether this displacement has consequences for chromosome condensation is unknown.

5.2.2. Sister chromatid cohesion
Aurora-B also controls chromosome cohesion. Cohesion is brought about by a ring-like Cohesin complex, which is related to the Condensin complexes. Cohesin topologically traps the two sister chromatids within its ring-structure [93]. Cohesion persists between sister chromatids until the metaphase to anaphase transition [94]. In vertebrate cells, Cohesin is removed in mitosis through two distinct mechanisms [95]. The first, referred to as the prophase pathway, removes Cohesin from chromosome arms in a fashion that depends on Plk-1 and Aurora-B [84], [96] and [97]. Aurora-B functions in this prophase pathway through control of the Shugoshin family of centromeric proteins. These proteins were identified as regulators of meiotic chromosome segregation in Drosophila and budding yeast [98] and [99]. The human counterpart of these proteins (Sgo1) protects centromeric Cohesin during mitosis via recruitment of a PP2A-phosphatase complex to the centromere [100], [101], [102], [103], [104] and [105]. Aurora-B activity confines Sgo1 localisation to centromeric regions and upon inhibition or depletion of Aurora-B, Sgo1 fails to concentrate on centromeres and instead localises diffusely along chromosome arms [82], [106] and [107]. Displacement of Sgo1 from centromeres (and its concomitant redistribution to the chromosome arms) causes protection of chromosome arm-localised Cohesin complexes against removal [100], [101] and [103]. Alternatively, since HP-1 influences Cohesin recruitment to chromatin [108] and [109], Aurora-B-dependent regulation of HP-1-chromatin retention might be an alternative way by which it influences chromosome cohesion.

5.2.3. Mitotic spindle assembly
Recently, Aurora-B has also been put forward as an important regulator of chromatin-induced spindle assembly in a pathway functioning in parallel to the Ran-dependent pathway. Aurora-B is activated on chromatin and depletion or inhibition of Aurora-B severely perturbs spindle assembly in Xenopus extracts [25], [110] and [111]. Two different Aurora-B substrates were suggested as downstream targets in this pathway. The first is the microtubule-depolymerising kinesin MCAK, since depletion of MCAK in Aurora-B depleted cells or extracts restored the chromosome-driven spindle pathway [110] and [112]. The second is the microtubule-destabilizing protein Stahtmin/Op18, whose activity is inhibited by Aurora-B phosphorylation in the vicinity of chromosomes [25] and [113].

5.2.4. Promoting chromosome bi-orientation
The microtubules of the mitotic spindle interact with chromosomes via kinetochores, large chromosome-embedded structures that constitute the main microtubule-binding site of the chromatids [114]. Kinetochores are required for microtubule-capture, chromosome movement and checkpoint signalling [115] and [116]. Equal segregation of the sister chromatids can only be achieved when the paired chromatids obtain bi-orientation on the mitotic spindle. This means that the two sisters within each chromatid pair have to be attached to an opposite pole of the bipolar spindle. This kind of bipolar attachment will invariably produce tension over the two paired sister chromatids caused by the pulling force generated by the mitotic spindle that is opposed by the cohesion between the paired sister chromatids.

5.2.5. Syntelic chromosome attachments
Kinetochore capture by the mitotic spindle is a stochastic process that will give rise to intermediate states of attachment. Non-bipolar attachments in which both kinetochores bind microtubules emanating from the same pole (also called syntelic attachments) occur during every mitosis and need to be corrected to eventually produce bi-orientation [117], [118] and [119]. These attachments are actively destabilised through the activity of Aurora-B [118], [120] and [121]. Unattached kinetochores can now enter a new cycle of microtubule attachment until bipolar attachment is obtained. Two important kinetochore microtubule-capture factors (the Ncd80/Hec1- and Dam1-complexes) are subject to phospho-regulation by Aurora-B [120] (Fig. 2). In addition, Aurora-B phosphorylates MCAK, and this also contributes to the correction of defective attachments [122], [123] and [124]. Phosphorylation of Ndc80/Hec1 by Aurora-B reduces its affinity for microtubules in vitro [125] and mutation of the putative Aurora-B phosphorylation-sites in Ndc80/Hec1 stabilises microtubule-kinetochore interactions in vivo [126]. Additionally, several subunits of the Dam1-complex are also substrates of the budding yeast Aurora-B (Ipl1) and mutation of phosphorylation-sites within the Dam1-subunit of this complex causes chromosome segregation defects similar to those occurring in Ipl1-mutants [120]. However, an orthologous complex for the Dam1 complex has not yet been found in organisms other than budding yeast. In summary, Aurora-B influences the stability of microtubule-kinetochore interactions by controlling the function of key microtubule-capture factors on the kinetochore. It is capable of destabilising defective non-bipolar attachments and as such functions as an error-correction factor that ensures faithful segregation of sister chromatids.

Note that it is a simplified representation, since several other microtubule-binding proteins have been identified that localise to the kinetochore. However, for these proteins it is not yet known if they are regulated by Aurora-B. Additionally, mammalian kinetochores most likely consist of repeated arrays of these single interfaces. Furthermore, mammalian orthologues of the Dam1-ring complex have not yet been identified.

5.2.6. Merotelic chromosome attachments
Merotely is an attachment state in which one kinetochore attaches to microtubules from both poles. Merotelic attachments occur frequently in early mitosis and when left uncorrected they induce anaphase lagging chromosomes and can result in aneuploidy [127], [128] and [129]. The majority of merotelic attachments are resolved in prometaphase and recent studies identified a major function for Aurora-B in this correction process. Aurora-B becomes enriched at centromeres of merotelically attached kinetochores where it promotes kinetochore-microtubule turnover [130] and [131] most likely via regulation of MCAK. Aurora-B influences the function of MCAK at different levels. First, Aurora-B activity is required for the concentration of MCAK on centromeres [122], [123] and [131]. Second, phosphorylation of MCAK within its neck region inhibits its microtubule-destabilising activity in vitro and expression of phospho-defective MCAK mutants (containing serine/threonine to alanine mutations on all Aurora-B sites) causes clear chromosome alignment defects [111] and [122]. This kind of negative regulation of a microtubule-destabilising factor seems at odds with the well-established role of Aurora-B in promoting destabilisation of defective microtubule-kinetochore interactions. Interestingly, however, MCAK that is specifically recruited to merotelic attachments (in an Aurora-B-dependent fashion) is hypophosphorylated within its neck-domain, suggesting that it is active [131]. Third, Aurora-B also indirectly influences MCAK function. Aurora-B interacts with ICIS, a centromeric protein that can stimulate MCAK activity in vitro [132] and Aurora-B is also required to target Sgo2 to centromeres. Interestingly, Sgo2 depletion caused a displacement of MCAK from centromeres and an increase in the amount of merotelic attachments [133]. Clearly, regulation of MCAK by Aurora-B is complex and has an effect on multiple important processes that influence chromosome segregation.

5.2.7. The spindle assembly checkpoint
The spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), also known as the mitotic checkpoint, guards the metaphase to anaphase transition. It prevents chromosome segregation and mitotic exit in the presence of unattached or non bi-oriented chromosomes [134]. A single unattached kinetochore is sufficient to halt mitotic progression and prevent sister-chromatid segregation on all chromosomes [135] and [136]. The core spindle assembly checkpoint consists of Mps1 and the conserved Mad (Mad1, Mad2, and Mad3/BubR1) and Bub (Bub1 and Bub3) proteins [134], [137], [138] and [139]. The SAC controls the activity of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) [140], [141] and [142]. Once activated, the APC/C promotes anaphase and mitotic exit by targeting, among others, two essential mitotic regulators, Securin and Cyclin-B for destruction by the 26S proteasome [140], [141], [143], [144] and [145]. The APC/C functions in conjunction with two different specificity factors, Cdc20 or Cdh1 [146] and [147]. The SAC prevents activation of APC/CCdc20 by promoting formation of an inhibitory complex composed of Mad2, Mad3/BubR1, Bub3 and Cdc20 [148]. All checkpoint proteins localise at kinetochores and while some checkpoint proteins (i.e. Mad1 and Mad2) are completely displaced from microtubule-attached kinetochores, kinetochore retention of others (e.g. BubR1) is more responsive to the amount of tension between sister kinetochores [149], [150] and [151]. This observation, together with the finding that the presence or absence of tension on a single chromatid pair could influence anaphase onset, led to the idea that either the presence of unattached kinetochores or the lack of tension between sister kinetochores could signal activation of the SAC [152] and [153]. A lack of tension may trigger a checkpoint response in two alternative ways, either “directly” in the complete absence of unattachments or “indirectly” by triggering the creation of unattached kinetochores that subsequently activate the checkpoint [154]. To compare the SAC response to unattached kinetochores versus the response to kinetochores experiencing a lack of tension, cells have classically been treated with microtubule-destabilising (e.g. Benomyl or Nocodazole) or microtubule-stabilising (e.g. Taxol) drugs. Whereas both treatments caused a SAC-dependent mitotic arrest, Aurora-B was required for the arrest in response to Taxol, but less essential for the arrest imposed by microtubule-destabilising drugs [155], [156], [157], [158] and [159]. As mentioned, a well-established function of Aurora-B is to destabilise defective attachments. Upon the presence of attachments that do not generate tension (as is the case upon Taxol-treatment), the activity of Aurora-B drives the detachment of such kinetochore-microtubule interactions and thus the recruitment checkpoint proteins to kinetochores, resulting in inhibition of APC/CCdc20. It is important to note that Taxol-treated mitotic cells contain a limited number of unattached kinetochores that are created by the chromosomal passenger complex [160], making it impossible to use this system to investigate the presence of a “direct” tension pathway. Experiments in which defective attachments were created by introducing several mutations in kinetochore components provided further proof for the “indirect” role for Aurora-B activity in checkpoint function by creating unattached kinetochores [161]. Recent data showed that besides this role, the chromosomal passenger proteins are also required for a checkpoint response even in the presence of a limited amount of unattached kinetochores [160]. Similarly, in Xenopus XTC cells and in S. pombe, Aurora-B activity is clearly required for the checkpoint in response to unattached kinetochores [162], [163] and [164], suggesting both direct and indirect effects of this complex on the checkpoint. Yet, experiments performed in budding yeast suggested a role for Ipl1 in a “direct” tension signal that activates the checkpoint in the absence of unattached kinetochores through phosphorylation of Mad3 (the orthologue of BubR1) [165]. Although it is clear that Aurora-B influences BubR1 kinetochore retention in human cells [156], [157], [158] and [159], efforts have so far failed to demonstrate direct phosphorylation of BubR1 by Aurora-B in human cells [160] and [166]. In general, it is still unclear whether there exists a “direct” tension-specific SAC-pathway in human cells. This issue has proven to be very difficult to study because tension and attachment are so tightly linked [167].

5.2.8. Anaphase and cytokinesis
Upon SAC inactivation, APC/CCdc20 initiates anaphase onset by promoting destruction of Cyclin-B and Securin, causing a decrease in Cyclin-B-associated Cdk1 activity and resolution of cohesion between sister chromatids [145]. From anaphase onwards, Aurora-B localises to both the central spindle/midbody and to the cell cortex, to which it is transported via microtubules. Aurora-B activity is required for efficient execution of anaphase and cytokinesis in several organisms [80], [87], [156], [157], [168], [169] and [170]. Localisation of Aurora-B to the central spindle contributes to the rapid switch in microtubule dynamics during anaphase [171] and Aurora-B is also required for efficient disassembly of the mitotic spindle during telophase [172].

During cytokinesis, the cytoplasm is divided into two new daughter cells each containing a single nucleus. A cleavage furrow is generated by contraction of an actinomyosin ring that encircles the cell equator and eventually divides the cytoplasm into two [173]. It is important that the cleavage furrow only forms after chromosome segregation and that it is positioned correctly between the two daughter nuclei. An essential determinant of contractile ring function is the GTPase RhoA [174]. Active (GTP-bound) RhoA controls several downstream effectors involved cytokinesis [174]. RhoA function during cytokinesis is controlled in part by a central spindle-localised complex called centralspindlin. This complex, consisting of a GTPase activating protein (GAP) (MgcRacGAP/Cyk4) and a kinesin (Mklp-1/ZEN-4), influences RhoA by controlling localisation of Ect2, an essential Rho-GEF [175], [176], [177], [178] and [179]. Correct function and localisation of centralspindlin depends on Aurora-B activity [180], [181] and [182]. Aurora-B phosphorylates several other proteins involved in cytokinesis, like Vimentin [183], Myosin II regulatory light chain [184], Desmin, and GFAP [185]. In budding yeast, Ipl1 plays an additional role during cytokinesis by controlling the NoCut pathway that prevents abscission (the final step of cytokinesis) when chromosomes are present in the direct vicinity of the site of abscission [186]. Ipl1 controls the localisation of the anillin-related proteins Boi1 and Boi2 to the site of cleavage ingression where they can function as abscission inhibitors and prevent premature abscission and concomitant chromosome breakage [186].

5.3. Aurora-C
The third member of the Aurora family, Aurora-C (gene location 19q13.3 [187]) is the least studied. After its initial discovery, Aurora-C was described to localise to the centrosomes during anaphase and telophase [188], but later studies indicated that Aurora-C has a localisation pattern during cell division that is similar to Aurora-B (Fig. 1c). It was also shown that Aurora-C can interact with INCENP and Survivin [32], [33], [189], [190] and [191]. In line with its chromosomal passenger-like localisation, overexpression of a kinase-dead mutant of Aurora-C interfered with Aurora-B function by displacing it from its binding partners [191]. Aurora-C mRNA was initially described to be mainly expressed in testis [187], [188] and [192], but later studies reported on mRNA expression in certain non-testicular cancer cell lines [32]. Another study also detected mRNA expression of Aurora-C in several human adult tissues, albeit to significantly lower levels than in testis [190]. The Aurora-C protein is present in germ cells in the testis, but the protein could not be detected in adult tissues and/or cancer cell lines [189].

Aurora-C is required for spermatogenesis and male fertility in mice [193]. A recent study identified a homozygous mutation within the Aurora-C gene in a group of infertile men [194]. The mutated Aurora-C gene yielded a truncated kinase activity-deficient Aurora-C protein. The spermatozoa in these men were polyploid, again indicating a role for Aurora-C in maintaining a stable karyotype during male meiosis. The chromosomal region in which the Aurora-C gene is located is known to be deleted or translocated in certain human cancers cell lines but it is unclear whether Aurora-C deletion plays a causative role in tumourigenesis [187] and [188]. In conclusion, it is clear that Aurora-C plays an important role during spermatogenesis, but conclusive proof that it controls cell cycle progression in somatic and/or tumour cells is lacking.

6. Aurora kinases and cancer
6.1. Aurora-A
The Aurora-A gene is located on chromosome 20q13.2, a known hotspot of amplification in tumours. Indeed, several studies have shown amplification of the Aurora-A locus and concomitant overexpression of the Aurora-A protein in a multitude of tumours [195]. Overexpression of Aurora-A in tumour cells promotes colony formation, centrosome amplification and tumour growth in mouse xenograft studies (Fig. 3a) [196], [197], [198] and [199]. However, overexpression of Aurora-A in primary cells is not a potent inducer of cellular transformation [197] indicating that Aurora-A requires additional oncogenic events, such as activated Ras-signaling to promote transformation [200]. Meraldi et al. showed that the centrosome amplification that is observed upon Aurora-A overexpression is an indirect effect of a failure to execute cytokinesis, generating tetraploid cells with two centrosomes [198]. It is unclear how crucial the kinase activity of Aurora-A is in these overexpression effects, since overexpression of kinase-dead Aurora-A caused a similar amount of tetraploidisation [198]. Another study also found tetraploidisation upon expression of wild type Aurora-A, but, strikingly, not upon expression of kinase-dead Aurora-A [199]. It was shown that the kinase activity of Aurora-A is required to promote colony formation and tumour growth [196] and sequence analysis of Aurora-A in tumours with Aurora-A amplifications has not identified any kinase-inactivating mutations. Furthermore, a polymorphism at nucleotide-position 91 (Phe31Ile) that might control protein stability of Aurora-A has been linked to tumour susceptibility [200], [201] and [202].

It is still unclear how Aurora-A contributes to cellular transformation and tumourigenesis and how important its kinase activity is during this process. In this respect, it will be important to establish whether the phenotypes of overexpression of kinase-active Aurora-A or kinase-dead Aurora-A are identical, and to evaluate whether dominant-negative effects can explain these effects. Furthermore, it will be important to establish whether the effects seen upon Aurora-A overexpression, like tetraploidisation and centrosome amplification are also observed in human tumours harbouring Aurora-A amplifications. It has been suggested that Aurora-A overexpression interferes with the SAC [199], but a direct role for Aurora-A within this checkpoint has not been described. Since Aurora-B has a well-established role in the SAC, and because the Aurora kinases have similar consensus phosphorylations motifs, it should be investigated whether Aurora-A overexpression might also influence the cellular function of the other Aurora kinases. In Xenopus oocytes, Aurora-A was shown to enhance the translation of Mos, a mitogen activated protein kinase that is required to initiate oocyte maturation. Mos is an oncogene and functions through activation of the MAPK pathway. It is therefore possible that Aurora-A also promotes tumourigenesis through translational control of Mos [203]. In this respect it is interesting to note that Aurora-A overexpression works synergistically with active Ras-signaling, a pathway that is known to cause activation of the MAPK pathway, in promoting transformation [200].

There is a tight relation between Aurora-A overexpression, p53 function and the observed effect on cellular processes and tumourigenesis (Fig. 3a and b). Aurora-A directly phosphorylates p53, and as such controls p53 protein stability and transcriptional activity [204] and [205]. Moreover, the p53-induced protein Gadd45a was shown to interact and inhibit Aurora-A function [206]. Additionally, several reports have shown that p53 can directly inhibit Aurora-A function, potentially via its binding to the catalytic domain of Aurora-A [207] and [208]. Together, these findings suggest a close connection between p53 and Aurora-A that possible acts during cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. The effect of Aurora-A overexpression on tetraploidisation and centrosome amplification depends on the p53 status [198]. Both in human tumours and mouse models, amplification of Aurora-A shows clear correlation with p53 status [202].

A recent study in Drosophila showed that Aurora-A functions as a tumour suppressor [209] and [210]. In Drosophila, Aurora-A is required for correct spindle orientation during asymmetric neuroblast division [209] and [210]. Asymmetric stem cell division is required for the correct balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Disruption of asymmetric stem cell division can give rise to stem cell overproduction and concomitant tumour growth. These findings, together with the observation that Aurora-A levels are low in certain tumours [202] are important to keep in mind, especially in light of the current efforts that are made to exploit Aurora-A inhibition by chemical inhibitors as an antitumour therapeutic (see also below).

6.2. Aurora-B
The role of Aurora-B in tumourigenesis is less clear. Aurora-B is located on chromosome 17p13.1, a chromosomal region that has not been associated with amplification in tumours. There have been reports that Aurora-B is overexpressed in certain tumour types [195], but it is not clear whether the observed overexpression of Aurora-B is a mere reflection of the high proliferative index of cancerous cells or whether it is indeed causally related to tumourigenesis. Some studies have shown that forced expression of Aurora-B can enhance cellular transformation. For example, expression of Aurora-B in CHO cells was reported to promote aneuploidy and increase invasiveness in xenograft experiments [211]. Furthermore, Aurora-B overexpression strongly enhances cellular transformation in cells expressing oncogenic Ras-V12 [212]. Nonetheless, there is little evidence that Aurora-B truly functions as an oncogene during human tumourigenesis, in contrast to the well-documented oncogenic function of Aurora-A.

7. Small molecule inhibitors for Aurora kinases
The process of cell division is instrumental to the development and progression of tumours and targeting cell division has classically been a successful antitumour therapy. So far, most antimitotic compounds (such as the vinca alkaloids and taxanes) target the mitotic spindle and as such trigger mitotic arrest, but recent efforts have yielded promising compounds targeting regulatory proteins during mitosis. It is likely that such compounds will exhibit less severe side effects as compared to the compounds targeting general microtubule dynamics, since they are not expected to interfere with the proper function of interphase cells. The Aurora kinases have shown to be promising clinically relevant anti-cancer targets. In the recent years several small molecule ATP-competitive inhibitors have been described that target the Aurora kinase family. For a comprehensive list of all current Aurora kinase inhibitors and their specificities, we refer the reader to an excellent review by Taylor and Peters [213]. The first inhibitors to be described were Hesperadin [157], ZM447439 [156] and VX-680 [214]. Treatment of cells with either Hesperadin or ZM447439 causes a failure to correct non-bipolar attachments and spindle checkpoint defects [156] and [157]. Treatment of cells with these inhibitors causes largely identical cellular phenotypes, being very similar to the phenotypes that were observed upon inhibition of Aurora-B through RNAi [156] and [157]. All three compounds show a marked decrease in mitotic phosphorylation of Histone H3 on serine 10, a phosphorylation associated with Aurora-B activity [156], [157] and [214]. Additionally, these all caused cytokinesis failure and the appearance of tetra- and polyploid cells. It is known that tetraploid cells with extra numerous centrosomes often arrest in G1 in a p53-dependent manner, presumably because of a general stress-response [215]. Indeed, p53 status is an important determinant of the proliferation rate of cells upon Aurora-B inhibition [156]. VX-680 treatment of mice bearing established xenografted tumours caused significant regression of tumour size. This regression was associated with the induction of apoptosis and reduction of Histone H3 phosphorylation, showing in vivo efficacy of this inhibitor with little side effects [214]. These findings indicate that their main in vivo functional target is Aurora-B.

Recently, several inhibitors have been described that more selectively inhibit either Aurora-A or -B in vivo and in vitro. MLN8054 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor that inhibits Aurora-A at the nanomolar range in vitro (IC50 4nM) whereas Aurora-B was approximately 40-fold less sensitive to this compound (IC50 172nM) [216]. In vivo, Aurora-A was inhibited by μM concentrations (IC50 0.034μM), and at these concentrations no inhibition of Aurora-B activity was observed, although at higher concentrations the compound did inhibit Aurora-B activity. This compound causes defects in bipolar spindle assembly and associated chromosome congression defects. After an initial mitotic arrest, MLN8054-treated cells exit mitosis, leading to aneuploidy and centrosome amplification [217]. All these phenotypes are similar to those observed upon depletion of Aurora-A by RNAi, again underscoring the fact that this compound primarily targets Aurora-A in vivo [197]. By using an in vitro kinase assay with physiologically relevant conditions, Gridler et al. [218] showed that ZM447439 (originally shown to inhibit Aurora-A and -B to similar extents in vitro [156]) is a more potent inhibitor of Aurora-B relative to Aurora-A. This is in good agreement with the in vivo effects of ZM44439 [156]. These findings are also important to keep in mind when judging inhibitor-specificity based on in vitro kinase assays. The same study also described two second-generation derivatives of ZM447439, ZM2 and ZM3, which are more specific inhibitors for Aurora-A and Aurora-B, respectively. ZM2 showed in vivo phenotypes, such as monopolar spindle formation, associated with Aurora-A inhibition and a drug-resistant mutant form of Aurora-A was shown to revert this phenotype [218]. In a recent paper, Taylor and co-workers identified several spontaneous mutations in Aurora-B acquired after prolonged exposure to ZM447439. Expression of these mutant Aurora-B alleles rendered cancer cell lines resistant to several Aurora inhibitors [219]. This indicates that the anti-proliferative effects of these inhibitors are mostly attributable to Aurora-B (and not Aurora-A) inhibition. These findings also have important implications for future drug-development, since they imply that the development of second-generation Aurora inhibitors should focus on identifying compounds that target the mutated Aurora alleles, to minimise the development of drug-resistance in patients.

8. Conclusions
Inhibition of the Aurora kinases greatly inhibits tumour cell growth in cell culture and xenograft studies. Therefore, inhibition of the Aurora kinases is an attractive new anti-cancer therapeutic strategy. Most of the Aurora inhibitory compounds have entered phase I clinical trials that will tell us whether these compounds are tolerated by patients and what their side effects are. The compounds that are currently tested in the clinic inhibit at least Aurora-A and Aurora-B. The recent development of more selective inhibitors for Aurora-A and Aurora-B will also allow the comparison of their therapeutic potential for different types of cancer and for the evaluation of specific side effects. Inhibition of Aurora-A causes drastically different cellular phenotypes (i.e. monopolar spindle formation and associated mitotic arrest) as compared to Aurora-B inhibition (i.e. massive chromosome missegregation, premature mitotic exit and cytokinesis failure), whereas both seem to eventually trigger apoptotic cell death. This indicates that specific inhibitors of either kinase could eventually broaden our arsenal of anti-cancer therapeutics. Finally, it will be important to study if tumour cells will also acquire resistance to these small molecules after prolonged treatment in vivo and to understand the reason why. Apart from acquired mutations in Aurora-A and Aurora-B that render tumour cells insensitive to these compounds [219] one can also envisage that acquired expression of Aurora-C could affect the effectiveness of these compounds. These possibilities will be important future avenues to explore.
