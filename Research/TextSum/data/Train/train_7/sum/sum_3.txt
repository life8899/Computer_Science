The manuscript by Toji et al. 2004 identified LATS2 protein (a serine/threonine kinase) as a phosphorylation target of Aurora-A kinase, which is a prominent centrosome and nuclear protein of G2 phase cells and at the half phase spindle in metaphase and telophase cells. Phosphorylation of LATS2 was found to depend on the cell cycle wherein LATS2 was phosphorylated at the M phase and the G1/S phase. The authors also found that Aurora-A kinase phosphorylates LATS2 at the serine 83 position as determined by point-mutation analysis. Further, LATS2 was found to colocalize with Aurora-A in the centrosome and that phosphorylation of LATS2 is required for centrosome localization. The following results from the reference article were cited: LATS2 induces G2/M arrest and apoptosis, LATS2 localizes to centrosomes, LATS2 activated by phosphorylation, LATS2 is downstream of Aurora-A, LATS2 is homologous to LATS1, LATS2 S83 is phosphorylated by Aurora-A, LATS2 plays a role in cell cycle progression, and LATS1/2 were found in interphase and mitotic centrosomes. The methods were also cited namely the antibodies for LATS2, and the pCMVmyc-LATS2 plasmid. One manuscript cited that loss of LATS2 stimulated reduplication of centrosomes comparable to that observed when Cyclin E is expressed in absence of p53; however, the reference article only stated that it is not possible that LATS2 is involved in regulation of centrisomal duplication. In conclusion, the major findings of the reference article is that LATS2 is phosphorylated by Aurora-A and is localized to the centrosome and plays a role in cell cycle progression.
