In the manuscript by Toji et al., 2004, authors identified that Lats2, a counterpart of Lats1, is phosphorylated in mitosis by Aurora-A kinase and co-localized to the centrosome during the cell cycle. Further authors also showed that Aurora-A induced phosphorylation of Lats2 is important for its centrosomal localization during the cell cycle progression. Moreover, authors concluded that Lats2 phosphorylated in at least two distinct stages of the cell cycle process, G1/S phase and Mitotic phase, suggesting that Lats2 is regulated by multiple phosphorylation throughout the cell cycle. Overall this study delivers an important information like Lats2 is a novel centrosome-associated kinase that may help Lats2 to regulate the centrosome and/or mitotic spindle downstream of Aurora-A. Several articles cited this reference paper for their results:  Lats2 induced G2/M phase and subsequent apoptotic cell death, and Lats2 is localized to centrosome, Lats2 activated by phosphorylation at the onset of mitosis and plays an important role during the G2/M transition in in-vitro study, Lats2 is a homologous to Lats1 and undergoes cell cycle dependent phosphorylation and its residue S83 is phosphorylated by Aurora- A kinase, thus Lats2 is a downstream of Aurora-A, before mitotic entry Aurora-A contributes for the centrosome maturation  by recruiting Lats2 at the centrosome. This study is important to know the role of Aurora-A kinase which controls several aspects of cell division in mammalian cells and dysfunction of this kinase has been associated with a failure to maintain a stable chromosome content, a state that can contribute to the tumorigenesis.
