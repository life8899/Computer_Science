	Toji et al., 2004 reports on the regulation of Lats2, a tumor suppressor, by phosphorylation during the cell cycle. Lats2 functions as a tumor suppressor through the inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. The authors use cell synchronization assays to follow Lats2 phosphorylaton during the cell cycle. Cells arrested during M-phase with nocodozole treatment show Lats2 phosphorylation and cells arrested at G1/S  using thymidine-aphidicoline also show phosphorylation. This indicates Lats2 is regulated by two different phosphorylation events during the cell cycle. To identify the kinase responsible for Lats2 phosphorylation the authors performed in vitro kinase assays using recombinant fragments of Lats2. They demonstrated Lats2 is phosphorylated by Aurora-A kinase primarily on serine 83 and potentially other residues as well. To follow Lats2 phosphorylation in vivo the authors developed a S83 phospho-specific antibody and showed S83 is the primary site phosphorylated during cell cycle progression. The authors then demonstrated that Lats2 co-immunoprecipitates with Aurora-A and phosphorylated Lats2 also co-localized to centrosomes with Aurora-A throughout the cell cycle. This combined with the ability to phosphorylate Lats2 indicates Aurora-A regulates Lats2 activity and localization during cell cycle progression. Mutation of the S83 residue to a non-phosphorylatable cysteine inhibited centrosomal location indicating the importance of Lats2 phosphorylation for localization during cell cycle progression. Overall the paper represents  the important discovery and characterization of Lats2 regulation and localization during the cell cycle. The study shows Lats2 is a novel centrosome associated kinase that may regulate the mitotic spindle downstream of Aurora-A kinase.
