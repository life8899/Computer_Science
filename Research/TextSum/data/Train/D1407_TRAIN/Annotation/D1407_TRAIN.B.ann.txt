Over-expression of human Lats2/Kpm in HeLa cells has also shown to cause G2/M arrest through inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity and to induce apoptosis (Hori et al. 2000; Kamikubo et al. 2003), whereas over-expression of mouse Lats2 in v-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells has shown to inhibit G1/S transition through down-regulation of Cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase activity and to suppress tumorigenicity of NIH3T3/v-ras cells (Li et al. 2003). These observations suggest that Lats kinases act as tumour suppressors by inhibition of cell cycle progression or apoptosis. Although Lats1 was recently found to be phosphorylated by Cdc2 (Morisaki et al. 2002), the kinase that phosphorylates Lats2 has not yet been identified | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

These results indicate that Lats2 is phosphorylated not only at the M phase but also at the G1/S phase. This G1/S-phosphorylated band was also observed during interphase (Fig. 1A; 0, 1.5, 3, 10 and 12 h), indicating that Lats2 is phosphorylated during interphase. Therefore, these findings suggest that Lats2 is regulated by at least two distinct phosphorylation events during the cell cycle ...

In vitro kinase assays with Aurora-A were performed with these mutated sequences. A loading control experiment with Coomassie Blue staining showed that an equal amount of each protein had been applied (Fig. 2C, right panel).

GFP-Lats2 was observed as one or two bright spots beside the nucleus in interphase (left panels, i and ii; green). In prophase, these bright spots translocated toward the opposite poles of the cell (left panel, iii). A similar pattern was also observed for Aurora-A, except that Aurora-A was located within the nucleus (middle panels; red). The nuclear localization of Aurora-A was detected with both of the anti-Aurora-A antibodies and we observed no signal with the secondary antibody alone in our experiments (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that the localization of Aurora-A in the nucleus as determined by these two antibodies is as a result of cross-reaction of anti-Aurora-A antibodies. The yellow spots in the merged images indicate that GFP-Lats2 co-localizes with Aurora-A during interphase, prophase and telophase (right panels). However, when the cells enter metaphase, the GFP-Lats2-specific signal was diffusely distributed throughout the cell (left panel, iv), whereas Aurora-A was localized to two predominant bright spots that are reminiscent of the spindle microtubules and the spindle poles.
