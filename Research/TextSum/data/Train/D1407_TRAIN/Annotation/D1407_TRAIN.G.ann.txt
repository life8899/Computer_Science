This conversion was completely blocked by the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 1B, lane 12), indicating that Lats2 is indeed phosphorylated at the M phase, in which nocodazole-treated cells are arrested by the spindle assembly checkpoint | Discourse Facet:  Implication_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

Together with the previous reports that Aurora-A is localized to the interphase and mitotic centrosomes as well as to the spindle poles (Bischoff et al. 1998; Zhou et al. 1998), these results indicate that Lats2 co-localizes with Aurora-A at the centrosomes during interphase, early prophase and cytokinesis ... That Lats2 localizes to centrosomes during interphase was also confirmed by its co-localization with γ-tubulin (Fig. 4C) | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  G, |

Because the phosphorylation of S83 on Lats2 is one of requirements for centrosomal localization of Lats2 in this issue, Aurora-A may also promote the recruitment of Lats2 to centrosomes as well as Cyclin B1/Cdc2 complex and D-TACC for the centrosome maturation | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  G, |
