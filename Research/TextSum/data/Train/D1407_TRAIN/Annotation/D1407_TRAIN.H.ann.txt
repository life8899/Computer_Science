This conversion was completely blocked by the addition of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig. 1B, lane 12), indicating that Lats2 is indeed phosphorylated at the M phase, in which nocodazole-treated cells are arrested by the spindle assembly checkpoint ... This conversion was also completely blocked by the addition of phosphatase inhibitors. These results indicate that Lats2 is phosphorylated not only at the M phase but also at the G1/S phase ... In this study, we have shown that Lats2 is phosphorylated in at least two distinct stages of the cell cycle, G1/S phase and M phase containing nocodazole arrest (Fig. 1A and B), suggesting that Lats2 is regulated by multiple phosphorylations throughout the cell cycle | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  H, |

When we tested DNA-PK (Kim et al. 1999), Nek2 (Fry et al. 1995) and Aurora-A, we found that only Aurora-A could phosphorylate Lats2N efficiently in vitro (Fig. 1D) ... We identified a centrosomal kinase, Aurora-A, as one of the candidate kinases for phosphorylation of S83 residue on Lats2 ... Immunostaining data with the anti-phosphorylated S83 antibody reveals that S83 on Lats2 is phosphorylated in vivo during the cell cycle and it is more prominent during prophase and metaphase than interphase, anapahse and telophase, which is similar to the expression pattern of Aurora-A during the cell cycle (Fig. 4A and Bischoff et al. 1998).

A loading control experiment with Coomassie Blue staining showed that an equal amount of each protein had been applied (Fig. 2C, right panel). Whereas phosphorylation of the S91C, T93D or S94A mutants was not significantly altered, the phosphorylation of the S83C mutant was remarkably diminished (Fig. 2C, left panel) ... Taken together, we conclude that Aurora-A is the phosphorylating kinase of Lats2 in the M phase because Aurora-A predominately phosphorylates S83 on Lats2 in vitro and this site is also phosphorylated in vivo ... Immunostaining data with the anti-phosphorylated S83 antibody reveals that S83 on Lats2 is phosphorylated in vivo during the cell cycle and it is more prominent during prophase and metaphase than interphase, anapahse and telophase, which is similar to the expression pattern of Aurora-A during the cell cycle (Fig. 4A and Bischoff et al. 1998).
