SummaryLucas DuncanToji et al investigated the possible interactions between the serine/threonine kinase Lats2, and the centrosome-associated kinase Aurora-A.  Lats2 is a counterpart to Lats1, which is phosphorylated in mitosis, however, little more is known about Lats2 itself.Toji et al. looked to establish when Lats2 is phosphorylated, and which kinase it is a target for. Using an antibody which recognized only the phosphorylated Lats2, they discovered that Lats2 has two separate phosphorylation events, one of which occurs during interphase.In vitro, Toji et al. found that the only kinase that was shown to phosphorylate Lats2 effectively was Aurora-A. Further experimentation, with different deletion mutants of Lats2, revealed that Aurora-A phosphorylated Lats2 at a serine-83 residue. This S83 residue was also found to be conserved between the Lats2 kinases of mice and humans. Using an antibody directed specifically against phosphorylated Lats2, Toji et al. investigated whether Aurora-A was also responsible for phosphorylating Lats2 in vivo. Further, it was demonstrated that Aurora-A and Lats2 interacted in vivo, through an immunoprecipitation process. Imaging of Lats2 and Aurora-A in vivo showed that they also co-localized at the centrosome. It was further demonstrated that the centrosome was where Lats2 is phosphorylated, and also that that localization plays an important factor into when Lats2 is phosphorylated. All the evidence of these experiments establish that Lats2 is a phosphorylation target of Aurora-A, and that this interaction plays a key role in Lats2 centrosomal localization.
