Abstract
The large tumor suppressor gene (Lats1) encodes a protein kinase that is highly conserved from fly to human, and plays a crucial role in the prevention of tumor formation by controlling mitosis progression. We have found that in addition to the previously isolated 7.5 kb long form of Lats1 (Lats1L) mRNA, a less abundant, shorter, 3.4 kb primary transcript (Lats1S) also is expressed in the vertebrate retina. Compared to Lats1L, the sequence of Lats1S mRNA has a deletion of exons 6, 7, and 8 that corresponds to 792 bp of the open reading frame. Thus, 264 aa of the C-terminal region of the long transcript are missing in the Lats1S protein. The encoded truncated protein lacks four of eleven conserved kinase domains and the C-terminus. Our results suggest that the 3.4 kb transcript is a splice variant of the 7.5 kb transcript. We have found direct evidence that both the retinal 7.5 and 3.4 kb mRNAs are translated into 170 kDa and 120 kDa proteins, respectively. The expression of both isoforms in vertebrate cells raises the possibility that these Lats1 proteins may act as negative key regulators of the cell cycle, each of them performing a unique role.

1. Introduction
The origin and progression of human tumors often involve the loss or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, a finding that bears on the importance of identifying and characterizing such genes. One of these genes, large tumor suppressor (Lats/Warts), was first identified in Drosophila, and was found to encode a putative serine/threonine protein kinase [1] and [2]. Somatic cells mutant for Lats/Warts overproliferate to form large tumors in a variety of tissues in mosaic flies. Homozygous mutants display a wide range of developmental defects including the hypertrophy of imaginal discs and lethality at almost every stage during development [1].

There is strong evidence to support the tumor suppressor role of Lats in mammals as well. The expression of the human LATS1 gene in Drosophila rescues all developmental defects in homozygous Lats/Warts mutants and suppresses tumor formation in the mosaic flies, demonstrating that LATS1 is a functional ortholog of the Drosophila Lats gene [3]. Lats1-deficient mice exhibit abnormal mammary gland development, infertility and growth retardation, spontaneous large soft tissue sarcomas, ovarian stromal cell tumors, and are easily susceptible to induced tumors [4]. The ectopic expression of Lats1, on the other hand, suppresses anchorage-independent growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and tumor formation in athymic nude mice [5].

The tumor suppressor function of Lats1 is supported by biochemical studies that suggest that the Lats1 protein regulates the cell cycle by modulating Cdc2/cyclin A activity [3]. The phosphorylation of Lats1 changes its conformation and frees the Lats1 N-terminal region to bind to Cdc2, leading to the inactivation of the mitotic kinase activity of Cdc2. The reduction of Cdc2/cyclin A activity ultimately leads to G2/M arrest and delay of mitosis [6]. Additionally, a recent study has found that ectopic expression of LATS1 induces apoptosis in cancer cells, possibly by upregulating the level of BAX, a pro-apoptotic protein [5]. It appears, therefore, that Lats1 may regulate not only cell proliferation, but cell survival as well.

Another mammalian tumor suppressor gene that is believed to belong to the Lats gene family is Lats2/Kpm [7] and [8]. Lats2/Kpm is homologous to Lats1 and undergoes cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation [8]; its residue S83 is phosphorylated by Aurora-A kinase [9]. It has been shown that Lats2/Kpm expression is dependent on p53, a gene that induces cell apoptosis [10]. Like Lats1, it may be involved in cell growth by inducing G2/M arrest and apoptotic cell death [11] or by regulating the G1/S transition [12] through its kinase activity. Lats2/Kpm also acts as a modulator of the androgen receptor (AR) by mediating the repression of AR activity, and may contribute to the development of prostate cancer [13].

Lats/Warts and Lats2/Kpm belong to a larger subfamily of protein kinases that share high levels of sequence similarity and have an insert of about 40 amino acids between subdomains VII and VIII which distinguishes them from other somewhat homologous kinases of the AGC (protein kinase A, protein kinase G, protein kinase C) group. The kinases in this subfamily also appear to share involvement in cell cycle regulation and cell morphology.

In the process of investigating genes expressed in the retina, we have found that, in addition to the previously identified 7.5 kb form of Lats1 mRNA, a novel 3.4-kb form (Lats1S) exists in the vertebrate retina. Lats1S mRNA is both shorter in length and less abundant in the retina than its longer counterpart, Lats1L mRNA. The Lats1S protein (ΔLats1) may serve a different pathway than the Lats1L protein in retinal cells. The aim of the current study was to characterize the Lats1S cDNA and to establish the expression of its gene product in the retina.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis
Total RNA was isolated from tissues with the use of the RNAzol B reagent-chloroform extraction procedure (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). After formaldehyde gel electrophoresis of total RNA, gels were blotted onto Hybond-H+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). The RNA blots were prehybridized and hybridized in 0.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, 7% SDS and 1% BSA. cDNA probes were labeled by a multiprime DNA labeling system (Amersham) in the presence of [α-32P] dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham). The blots were washed at a final stringency of 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS and exposed to X-ray film (Hyperfilm-MP, Amersham) at −80 °C using an intensifying screen.

2.2. Screening of retinal cDNA library and sequence analysis
The oligo(dT)-primed unidirectional (NotI–SalI) canine cDNA retinal library was screened with a probe that corresponded to the fragment of the coding region of human LATS1 cDNA labeled by random priming. Positive plaques were isolated and the inserts were excised and subcloned into pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Nucleotide sequence determinations were performed with the Taq DyeDeoxy Termination Cycle Sequencing kit (ABI) in the ABI 3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Fragments needed to cover gaps in the cDNA sequence were obtained using specific internal primers.

2.3. Analysis of the human and canine sequences
Prior to alignment, the human LATS1 cDNA sequence was submitted to the human genome database (NCBI), and searches were carried out with the BLAST alignment tool. To compare the nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology of human LATS1 to its canine ortholog, we used the Sequencher 4.1 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI) and DNASTAR (DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) programs.

2.4. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblots
Proteins were separated on 6.5% acrylamide/1.5% bis acrylamide gels and electrophoresed in a tris/tricine buffer system as described by Schagger and associates [14] and [15] for 22 h at 35 mA constant current. They were then transferred to PVDF membranes [16] at 5 V/cm, 10 °C, overnight, and blocked in 3% BSA, 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris buffered saline (TBS, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6) for 2 h at 37 °C. The blots were then incubated for 3 h with a primary NK1 polyclonal antiserum raised against an 18-mer (N′-MKRSEKPEGYRQMRPKTF-C′, amino acid sequence residues 1 to 18) in the blocking solution supplemented with 0.5% normal goat serum. The NK1, 18-mer peptide polyclonal antibody was produced by Research Genetics, Inc. (Huntsville, AL) and was based on the conserved putative translated sequence of canine, mouse and human LATS1. Blots were visualized with either the Amplified-Alkaline Phosphatase kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) or the Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (ECL; Amersham Life Sciences, Inc), both utilizing enzymes conjugated to goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody.

3. Results
Previously, we had carried cDNA RDA (representational difference analysis) using normal and cd (cone degeneration) dog retinas to isolate cDNAs located in cone photoreceptor cells [17]. One of the isolated clones was a cDNA fragment that had a sequence showing high homology to human LATS1 cDNA. The radioactively labeled 740 bp fragment (nucleotide position 1570–2309) of human LATS1 cDNA was used as a probe to isolate the Lats1 cDNA from a canine retinal library. Plaques containing two different sizes of cDNAs, long and short, were isolated. Further study indicated that the long transcript is an ortholog of the previously described mouse and human Lats1 cDNA. Beginning at the first ATG codon, the 3367 bp short form of canine Lats1 cDNA (cLats1S) sequence ( Fig. 1) contained an open reading frame of 2592 bp, coding for an 863 amino acid protein with pI of 9.6, and a calculated molecular mass of 96 kDa. The cDNA included 280 bp of 5′ UTR and 495 bp of 3′ UTR sequence (GenBank Accession number: AY682720). Sequence analysis revealed that the canine Lats1S 3′-UTR has several cytosine-rich (C-rich) segments ( Fig. 1). Some of these are similar to elements 1A, 1B and 2, previously shown to be present in the human α-globin mRNA 3′-untranslated region. These C-rich elements have been associated with RNA stability when α-globin constructs are transfected into erythroid cells [18]. The only difference between the 1A element from the canine cLats1S and the human α-globin mRNA 3′-UTRs is the substitution of one nucleotide (CCTGCCC/CCTGCCA). Element 1B (GCCT/GCCT) is identical in both mRNAs and element 2 (CTCCCCTCCTTG/GTCCCCTCC-TG) has 92% sequence identity between cLats1S and human α-globin mRNAs. In addition, the 1A element in the canine Lats1S sequence is more distant from the other C-rich elements than in the  α-globin mRNA 3′-UTR. Interestingly, a sequence-specific ribonucleoprotein complex, containing a potentially novel poly(C)-binding protein, interacts with these three C-rich elements of α-globin mRNA 3′-UTR, and seems to protect the mRNA from degradation [18]. This observation raises the possibility that in canine retina the three elements of the cLats1S 3′-UTR may also be essential for mRNA stability and function.

A comparison of the known human and mouse Lats1L sequences, as well as the deduced canine Lats1L (c Lats1L cDNA was isolated by our group by RT-PCR and sequenced) with that of dog cLats1S cDNA, showed that the latter has a deletion of 792 bp in the 3′ end of the open reading frame coding for 264 aa of the C-terminal domain. Furthermore, the comparison between the canine Lats1 cDNAs (short and long) and dog genomic sequences deposited in the NCBI database (gb AAEX01059424.1) allowed us to establish the exon–intron organization of the dog LATS1 gene ( Fig. 2A). The gene is split into 8 exons and spans a region of about 24 kb on dog chromosome 1. All donor and acceptor sites follow the GT–AG rule. The location of the introns within the open reading frame is conserved between the genes encoding human, mouse, and dog, indicating a common ancestral gene structure (data not shown). Exons 6, 7, and 8 correspond to the deleted sequences from the C-terminus of cLats1S, and part of the 5′ end of intron E in the LATS1 gene constitutes the 3′ UTR of the cLats1S transcript produced by alternative splicing. As such, the alternative splicing generates a new stop codon at the end of exon 5, resulting in an isoform that codes for a truncated protein lacking four of eleven conserved kinase domains (subdomains VIII, IX, X, XI) and the C-terminus ( Fig. 2B). The 6 nt (AATTCT) coding Asn and Ser amino acid residues at position 93–94, and a Val at 362 (GTC codon) in the hLATS1L are deleted from the cLats1S protein ( Fig. 2B). In the truncated region, hLats1L and cLats1L differ by only two amino acids, S884N and N1117H. Despite these differences, the homology between cLats1S and hLATS1L remains very high (95%) for the exons that are represented in both species.

The Northern blot analysis of total RNA extracted from various dog tissues revealed that Lats1 mRNA is present in retina, spleen, kidney, cerebellum, heart, and muscle tissue as a 7.5 kb transcript, a finding that is consistent with previous studies [3] and [19]. In addition to this 7.5 kb Lats1L, the retina also shows the expression of a less abundant 3.4 kb Lats1S transcript ( Fig. 3A). To determine whether the Lats1 transcripts are localized in the photoreceptors or in the cells of the inner retina we investigated their expression in normal and rd (retinal degeneration) mouse retinas. The rd mouse is affected with an inherited disease that results in a specific loss of rod photoreceptors between postnatal days 10 and 20 (P10 and P20); cone cell death occurs thereafter. By one postnatal month the rd retina has approximately 50% of the original complement of cone nuclei. These nuclei slowly decrease in number during the following months [20]. Northern blots containing total RNA from normal and rd mouse retinas at different postnatal ages hybridized to the mouse Lats1L (mLats1L) probe showed both Lats1 mRNA forms. Moreover, the level of these transcripts did not change from P21 to P68 ( Fig. 3B). These results suggest that both Lats1 messages are not exclusively localized to cone photoreceptor cells, but to other retinal cell types as well.

An additional Northern blot confirmed the differences in the 3′ UTR of the long and short forms of Lats1 detected in the earlier sequence analysis. The radiolabeled probe containing only the 3′ UTR sequence of the 3.4 kb transcript did not hybridize to the 7.5 kb transcript whereas a probe from the 5′ UTR of the 3.4 kb transcript hybridized to both the 7.5 and 3.4 kb transcripts (data not shown), a result that concurs with similar findings in Drosophila [1]. This result, and the sequence identity of cLats1S 3′ UTR to the intron E of cLats1 gene, confirm that the 3.4 kb transcript is a splice variant of the 7.5 kb transcript.

Western blot analysis was conducted to verify whether both the short and long transcripts were translated into Lats1 proteins. We used the NK1 polyclonal antiserum raised against an 18-mer N-terminal peptide of the Lats1 protein (N′-MKRSEKPEGYRQMRPKTF-C′, residue 1–18 from the amino acid sequence) that has an identical sequence in human, mouse, and dog. Two distinct bands were detected from crude canine retinal extracts that corresponded to proteins of molecular mass 170 kDa and 120 kDa, respectively. Both immunoreactive bands were eliminated when we used the 18-mer peptide raised against the primary polyclonal antiserum as a competitor ( Fig. 4). This indicates that both bands are specifically associated to the Lats1 protein. At the same time, crude protein extracts from other tissues such as kidney, cortex, cerebellum, lung and heart showed only one immunoreactive band ( Fig. 4A).

Previous studies had also detected a similar shorter form of the Lats/Warts mRNAs in testis [3], [7] and [8]. Northern blot hybridization of the retinal cLats1S 5′ UTR probe to canine testis total RNA confirmed the expression of both the short and long forms of Lats1 in this tissue, with a higher expression of Lats1S. ( Fig. 3B). In addition, Western blot analysis showed that this mRNA is translated into ΔLats1 protein which, as in retina, has a relatively greater abundance than the larger isoform ( Fig. 4).

4. Discussion
The Lats1 protein belongs to a subfamily of the AGC group of kinases and encodes a putative Ser/Thr protein kinase. Besides having 11 highly conserved protein kinase catalytic subdomains, members of the AGC group of kinases have two consensus sequences required for phosphorylation. The T[F/L]CGT “activation loop” [21] is located within subdomain VIII, and the FXX[F/Y][S/T][F/Y] “hydrophobic motif” [22] and [23] is at the carboxy terminal end of the protein, downstream of subdomain XI. Both motifs are involved in kinase activity, and in the regulation of stability of many AGC kinases [24]. Millward et al. [23] have mapped two similarly conserved motif sequences in Ndr, a member of the subfamily of kinases responsible for the regulation of cell division and cell morphology (Lats1 is also related to this subfamily). The Ndr motifs are characterized by regulatory phosphorylation sites at Ser 281 and Thr 444. The location and sequence of the Thr 444 Ndr motif and the “hydrophobic motif” of AGC kinase are similar, but the Ser 281 phosphorylation site motif structure in Ndr and Ndr-related kinases differs from the “activation loop” sequence in the AGC kinases. The Ser 281 phosphorylation site is conserved in all Ndr-related kinases, in particular, the Lats kinases [25]. These differences aside, the motif pairs in Ndr-related and AGC kinases play a critical role in kinase activity, and are well conserved across different kinase proteins.

The ΔLats1 protein lacks subdomain VIII, which appears to be especially important in the recognition of peptide substrates and the activation of the enzyme, as well as subdomain IX which is involved in stabilizing the catalytic loop and hydrophobic interaction with the inhibitor peptide. Subdomains X and XI possess functions that are unclear [26]. In addition, the ΔLats1 protein does not contain the critical “hydrophobic motif” consensus sequences for phosphorylation. Since exons 6, 7, and 8 encode putative subdomains VIII–XI at the C-terminal end, the deletion of these exons could be responsible for the failure of the ΔLats1 protein to be activated as a kinase. Our results clearly indicate that both isoforms of Lats1 protein are expressed in retinal cells. It is interesting to point out that while at the mRNA level the retinal 7.5 kb transcript is more abundant than the 3.4 kb transcript, the opposite is observed in testis ( Fig. 3). However, both retina and testis have more protein translated from the 3.4 kb transcript than from the 7.5 kb mRNA. This is not unusual; the level of synthesized protein is not always proportional to the amount of mRNA present in the cells. We recently have shown that in the retina, the mRNA for the rod-specific β-subunit of cyclic GMP-phosphodiesterase (β-PDE) is 5-fold more abundant that mRNA for α-PDE; nevertheless, both translated proteins, β-PDE and α-PDE, are present at equimolar levels in the retina [27]. Similarly, it is possible that the efficiency of translation of the Lats1 transcripts differs in retina and testis.

Although the physiological and biochemical role of the ΔLats1 protein in the retina is currently not known, it is possible that it interacts with targets similar to those of Lats1L, with its action regulated differently because of dissimilar regulatory components. This might be an interesting direction for future research.

The LATS1 gene may also be involved in retinal diseases. The gene responsible for autosomal dominant cone dystrophy, a disease characterized by a progressive loss of visual acuity, sensitivity to light, and impaired color vision, has been mapped to the same region as the LATS1 locus [28]. Therefore, LATS1 chromosomal localization and expression in the retina make this gene a possible candidate for future cone dystrophy studies.
