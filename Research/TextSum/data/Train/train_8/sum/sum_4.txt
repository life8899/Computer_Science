MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous ∼22 nt RNA that can play important gene regulatory roles by base pairing to mRNA to specify posttranscriptional repression in nematodes, insects and plants. miRNA genes are one of the more abundant classes of regulatory genes in animals; however, involvements of the vertebrate miRNAs for the regulation of mRNA are all unknown. Sophisticated methods for predicting targets of insect miRNA have been published by Stark et al., 2003. Thus, in order to identify the targets of vertebrate miRNA, authors have developed an algorithm called TargetScan, which combines thermodynamics-based modelling of RNA-RNA duplex interactions with comparative sequence analysis to predict miRNA target conserved across multiple genomics. More than 400 regulatory target genes predicted using TargetScan for conserved vertebrate by identifying mRNAs with conserved pairing to the 5’ region of the miRNAs and evaluating the number and quality of these complementary sites. These predictions supported by rigorous test using shuffled miRNA controls, with the fraction of false positive estimated at 31% for targets identified in human, mouse, and rat, while 22% for targets identified in pufferfish and mammals. In HeLa cell reporter system, 11 out of 15 predicted targets were supported experimentally. Predicted mammalian miRNA targets were mainly for genes involved in transcriptional regulation but also have broad diversity of biological functions. Together, the present study develops a computational program which is useful for the prediction of mammalian miRNA targets and showed that conserved 5’ region of mammalian miRNA is the most important for the identification of target.
