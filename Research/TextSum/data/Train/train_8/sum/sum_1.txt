	Lewis et al., 2003 reports a new algorithm and bioinformatic tool called TargetScan that is able to identify mammalian microRNA targets. Previously, no target of vertebrate microRNAs had been reported.  The authors designed an algorithm that pairs thermodynamics-based modeling of RNA interactions with sequence analysis and are able to predict over 400 target genes regulated by the conserved vertebrate miRNAs. The algorithm uses a number of steps to predict targets including searching UTRs for segments of perfect complementarity to the 5' miRNA seed sequence and optimizing basepairing of the 3' end of the miRNA to the UTR. To validate the method the authors developed a control group of shuffled miRNAs  maintain the many physical properties and characteristics of the authentic miRNAs. Using this control the authors demonstrate TargetScan identifies target genes with a signal to noise ratio of about 3.5:1. TargetScan also found multiple targets per miRNA with an average of 3.9 targets per miRNA. Many of these targets had GO terms associated with transcriptional regulation. Next to validate the biological significance of the identified targets the authors then constructed luciferase reports contained the UTRs of targets sites as well as versions containing mutated target sites. As expected, for 11 out of 15 candidates the luciferase construct was upregulated upon mutation of the miRNA target site indicating the miRNA target site was responsible for transcriptional repression of the the target genes. The study demonstrates a powerful bioinformatic tool to identify miRNA target genes that will help guide future miRNA research.
