Wang et al. examined the role of microRNAs in cervical cancer. Non-coding miRNAs are often implicated in a wide array of cancers, as their expression has a large scale effect on the expression of many different genes post-transcriptionally. To examine which miRNAs might play a role, the miRNAs of a cervical cancer cell line were extracted and cloned. This screening led to the cloning of 174 miRNAs To examine how miRNAs were expressed in cervical cancer differently from normal tissue, Wang et al. ran a comparative miRNA assay on cervical cancer and normal tissues. 9 miRNAs were expressed at a greater level in the normal tissues, and 4 were found to be expressed at a higher level in the cervical cancer tissues.Wang et al. then compared the miRNA signatures of the cervical cancer to HPV-infected raft tissues to see which miRNA expressions were cancer-specific. Two miRNAS, miR-143 and 145, were investigated, as their absence was noted in both cervical lesions and cancer cells. Wang et all found that when the precursors to these miRNAs were transfected into a HELA cell line, it had a suppressive effect on tumor formation. Additionally, Wang et al. found that exogenous miR-146a played a role in enhancing cell proliferation in cancer cell lines, though it was not found at elevated levels in many cancer cell lines. Overall, miRNAs demonstrated different levels of expression and effectiveness.
