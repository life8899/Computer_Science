Wang et al. identified a subset of miRNAs and showed their significant role in downregulation and upregulation in cervical cancer and pre-neoplastic lesions. miRNAs are regulatory, non-coding RNAs with 21-23 nucleotide in length that are found in cell differentiation and are responsible for post-transcriptional process. Authors used miRNA expression from cervical cancer-derived CaSki C-2 cell lines and from HPV-infected vaginal keratinocytes (CaSki cells). They reported the miR-24, miR-27a, and mir-205 as most abundant miRNAs. Using a clustering analysis, authors found 16 miRNAs that were upregulated and 25 miRNAs that were downregulated. miR-143 and miR-145 were found suppressive to HeLa cell growth and need to be downregulated in cervical cells. miR-146a has been found to function as a growth factor in upregulating the cancer process. The introduction of mir146a into cervical cancer cells increased cell doubling time and promoted cell proliferation which suggest that miR-146a works as an ”oncogenic” miRNA. High level downregulated mir-146a in both cervical and normal tissues suggests that this miRNA is cervical cancer-specific. miR-15b, miR-16, miR24, and miR-155 are other miRNAs that have been found to be upregulated in cervical cancer. miR-126 was identified as a metastasis suppressing miRNA that is downregulated in cervical cancer. Authors found that more than 68% of the miR-21 isolated from CaSki cells had an additional C at the 3’ end and 33% of the miR-205 isolated contained an extra 5’ ends of either miRNA. The finding of this work could be beneficial in research study for cancer and drug target design.
