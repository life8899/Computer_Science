While RB disruption is the sine qua non of retinoblastoma, RB loss occurs in many tumor types ... The p53 gene is mutated in more than 50% of human cancers, and mutations in other genes that affect p53 function occur in many, if not all, tumors that retain a normal p53 gene. Among these are mutations affecting Hdm2, ARF, and a series of transcription factors that control ARF and p53 gene expression | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |

In addition E2F1 also stabilizes p53 via p19(p14)/ARF-independent mechanisms that may include direct binding to p53 and/or changes that promote the phosphorylation of p53 [20],[21],[22]. This activity of E2F, which acts upstream of p53, is thought to be a critical tumor suppressor pathway [23] | Reference Offset:  ['11278-11752', '19891-20494', '20891-21172'] | Reference Text:  There is now compelling evidence that particular components of this regulatory machinery act as tumor suppressors or protooncogenes, whose mutations occur so frequently as to prompt speculation that disabling “the RB pathway” may be essential for the formation of cancer cells (Sherr, 1996, Sellers and Kaelin, 1997, Nevins, 2001, Hahn and Weinberg, 2002 and Ortega et al., 2002). While RB disruption is the sine qua non of retinoblastoma, RB loss occurs in many tumor types ... The ability of deregulated E2F to induce ARF transcription provides one connection between the RB pathway and p53 ( DeGregori et al., 1997 and Bates et al., 1998) and may help to explain why most tumors have defects in the p53 pathway. Overexpression of E2F in established cell lines lacking ARF or p53 can enforce S phase entry even in the absence of mitogenic stimulation ( Johnson et al., 1993, Qin et al., 1994 and Shan and Lee, 1994), but nonimmortal human diploid fibroblasts instead undergo an ARF-dependent p53 response leading to G1 phase arrest and, later, to apoptosis ( Lomazzi et al., 2002) ... in mouse tumor models lacking functional RB or overexpressing E2F, Arf loss does not invariably diminish apoptosis or accelerate tumorigenesis ( Russell et al., 2002, Tolbert et al., 2002 and Tsai et al., 2002), indicating that E2F can activate p53 through Arf-independent pathways | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator:  B, |
