This table summarizes approximate frequencies of Ink4a loss (by mutation, deletion, or gene silencing), RB mutation or deletion, and cyclin D1 or Cdk4 overexpression in different forms of cancer ...

The ability of deregulated E2F to induce ARF transcription provides one connection between the RB pathway and p53 ( DeGregori et al., 1997 and Bates et al., 1998) and may help to explain why most tumors have defects in the p53 pathway | Discourse Facet:  Results_Citation | Annotator:  G, |
