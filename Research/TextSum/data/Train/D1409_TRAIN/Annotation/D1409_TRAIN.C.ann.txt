Here, we discuss interconnecting signaling pathways controlled by RB and p53, attempting to explain their potentially universal involvement in the etiology of cancer ... Yet, despite the existence of many forms of cancer and global changes in gene expression profiles observed in cancer cells versus normal cells, a relatively small number of essential alterations are shared by most, and perhaps all, tumors (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). Such mutations can disrupt normal growth control in response to environmental cues, or can dismantle cell cycle checkpoints that otherwise limit cell division or that induce cell suicide in response to DNA damage or oncogene activation. RB and p53 are central to these processes ... Hence, human cells lacking intact RB and p53 checkpoints eventually experience telomere dysfunction, leading to chromosomal end-end joining and fusion-bridge-breakage cycles that trigger the aneuploidy observed in most carcinomas ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000, Sherr and DePinho, 2000, Wright and Shay, 2000, Hahn and Weinberg, 2002 and O'Hagan et al., 2002) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator: C, |

Enforced overexpression of p19Arf in primary MEFs induces cell cycle arrest ( Quelle et al., 1995), whereas induction of Arf by ectopically expressed E2F1 or by certain oncoproteins, such as Myc or adenovirus E1A (see below), is accompanied by apoptosis ( De Stanchina et al., 1998; Zindy et al., 1998) ... Activation of the Arf-Mdm2-p53 pathway reroutes cells that have sustained oncogenic damage to alternative p53-dependent fates—growth arrest or apoptosis (Figure 3). Disruption of this pathway eliminates this form of tumor surveillance and enables oncogenes to drive uncontrolled cell proliferation. By inducing Arf and Ink4a in primary rodent fibroblasts, oncogenic Ras expression leads to growth arrest and premature senescence ( Serrano et al., 1997 and Ferbeyre et al., 2002) ...

These regulators include cyclin D1 in breast carcinoma, head and neck tumors and mantle cell lymphomas, CDK4 in glioblastomas, p16/INK4A loss in melanoma, pancreatic carcinoma and T cell lymphoma and Bmi-1 in B-cell lymphomas [2] | Reference Offset:  ['11122-12202', '13936-14973', '26648-27514'] | Reference Text:  The biochemical activities of the INK4 proteins, cyclin D-dependent kinases, and RB family proteins highlight a pathway controlling G1 phase progression: There is now compelling evidence that particular components of this regulatory machinery act as tumor suppressors or protooncogenes, whose mutations occur so frequently as to prompt speculation that disabling “the RB pathway” may be essential for the formation of cancer cells (Sherr, 1996, Sellers and Kaelin, 1997, Nevins, 2001, Hahn and Weinberg, 2002 and Ortega et al., 2002).

In contrast to p16INK4a and RB, which seem to play specific roles in checkpoint control, the selective involvement of particular D-type cyclins in tumorigenesis may also reflect their normal patterns of tissue-specific expression during development. Consistent with observations that D1, and not D2 or D3, is the major D-type cyclin expressed in both retinal and mammary epithelial tissues, mice lacking cyclin D1 exhibit retinal hypoplasia and defective lobuloalveolar development of breast epithelium during pregnancy ( Fantl et al., 1995 and Sicinski et al., 1995). Conversely, enforced expression of a cyclin D1 transgene in the breast tissue of mice predisposes to mammary cancer ( Wang et al., 1994). Moreover, whereas mice overexpressing Her2/Neu or oncogenic Ras transgenes targeted to mammary epithelium rapidly develop breast cancer, they fail to do so in a cyclin D1 null background, indicating that D1 function is essential for tumorigenesis and that other D-type cyclins in breast tissue cannot compensate ( Yu et al., 2001) ... Susceptibility to familial melanoma was mapped to the INK4a-ARF locus, and the critical mutations in some kindreds affect p16INK4a but not p14ARF function ( Kamb et al., 1994). However, mice lacking Ink4a-Arf rarely develop melanoma unless crossed with animals that express a Ras transgene in appropriate target cells ( Chin et al., 1997 and Bardeesy et al., 2001). When animals containing a mutant Ink4a allele were crossed with mice lacking the entire Ink4a-Arf locus, heterozygotes spontaneously developed melanomas, and dimethylbenzanthrene treatment resulted in a higher frequency of aggressive tumors ( Krimpenfort et al., 2001). Thus, a subtle constellation of genetic events involving p16Ink4a inactivation and Arf haploinsufficiency programs a different outcome than complete loss of Ink4a-Arf, which predisposes to other tumor types ( Serrano et al., 1996) | Discourse Facet:  Discussion_Citation | Annotator: C, |

This activity of E2F, which acts upstream of p53, is thought to be a critical tumor suppressor pathway [23] | Reference Offset:  ['20127-21172', '22197-22822', '31680-32362'] | Reference Text:  Overexpression of E2F in established cell lines lacking ARF or p53 can enforce S phase entry even in the absence of mitogenic stimulation ( Johnson et al., 1993, Qin et al., 1994 and Shan and Lee, 1994), but nonimmortal human diploid fibroblasts instead undergo an ARF-dependent p53 response leading to G1 phase arrest and, later, to apoptosis ( Lomazzi et al., 2002). Enforced overexpression of p19Arf in primary MEFs induces cell cycle arrest ( Quelle et al., 1995), whereas induction of Arf by ectopically expressed E2F1 or by certain oncoproteins, such as Myc or adenovirus E1A (see below), is accompanied by apoptosis ( De Stanchina et al., 1998; Zindy et al., 1998). Arf deficiency partially protects cells from apoptosis induced by these proteins. However, in mouse tumor models lacking functional RB or overexpressing E2F, Arf loss does not invariably diminish apoptosis or accelerate tumorigenesis ( Russell et al., 2002, Tolbert et al., 2002 and Tsai et al., 2002), indicating that E2F can activate p53 through Arf-independent pathways ... A mutant form of E2F (E2F-DB) that binds to DNA but neither interacts with Rb nor transactivates E2F target genes can displace Rb-E2F complexes from promoters. When this mutant was overexpressed in primary MEFs, disruption of Rb-E2F-mediated repression increased the expression of E2F target genes, including Arf ( Rowland et al., 2002). Despite the activation of a persistent p19Arf-mediated p53 response, cells expressing E2F-DB were immortal and resistant to ectopic overexpression of either p19Arf or p53. Therefore, Rb (family)-E2F-mediated repression is required for cell cycle exit in response to p19Arf-p53 activation ... An adenovirus expressing a mutant form of E1A that cannot bind RB should replicate selectively and kill cells lacking functional RB ( Fueyo et al., 2000). A variant in which both the viral E4 and mutant E1A genes are placed under the control of the human E2F1 promoter selectively kills tumor cells with deregulated E2F, whereas normal cells halt viral replication in an RB-dependent manner ( Johnson et al., 2002). Such viruses are effective and relatively safe systemic antitumor agents in xenograft models.
