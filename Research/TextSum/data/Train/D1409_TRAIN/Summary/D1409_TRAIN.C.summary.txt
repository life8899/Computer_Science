Evolution of cancer is a complex process and there are many reports which share different gene profiles of cancerous cells versus normal cells. Retinoblastoma protein (RB) and p53 are among the most prominent transcription factors showing disrupted regulation behavior in cancer cells. Sherr and McCormick, 2002 is a review which explains the involvement of RB and p53 in interconnecting signaling pathways which affects cancer origin and progression. RB binding to E2F family of the transcription factors plays a central role in DNA replication and is associated with RB`s function as a tumor suppressor. Among INK4 family, p16ink4a is found to play some specific roles in driving abnormal cell growth. The authors highlight here the RB pathway which connects the INK4 proteins, cyclin D kinases and RB proteins, acts in a mutually exclusive manner such that one mutation/deletion is unaccompanied by others. Further, the authors describe the role of p53 gene in cancer and its connectivity to RB protein. Deregulated E2F which induces Arf transcription provides an explanation to connectivity between RB pathway and p53 which in turn alters cell cycle arrest. Also, the options for targeted therapies based on p53 and RB pathway is discussed here. Altogether, this paper gives a detailed insight into the underlying mechanisms of cancer progression which will be helpful in finding effective chemotherapeutic options.
