The manuscript by PA Campbell et al. 2007 describes the identification of novel Oct4 functional roles using a coexpression of gene analysis that was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip technology as part of the Stem Cell Genomics Project. Oct4 correlated genes were identified in a variety of mouse embryonic stem cell (ESCs) samples that were either adult or stem cells of different differentiated stages. The gene expression profiling methods in this paper were referred to by one author. Most citing manuscripts referred to the implications of the results in this manuscript. For instance, the following implications from the results were used: involvement of Oct4 in chromatin remodeling, Oct4 transcriptional networks regulate self-renewal and pluripotency, apoptosis repressing genes positively correlate with Oct4 and apoptosis inducing genes negatively correlate with Oct4, and Oct4 affects early differentiation genes. One manuscript used data from the transcriptional network to make a new figure, which showed which genes are up and down regulated in MI oocytes and 2-cell embryos. Another manuscript referred to the results that were devoid of iPS cell and iPS-BC enriched genes as Oct 4 targets. In the results section of one manuscript, they referred to the methods for investigating patterns of Oct4 expression in different cells at different stages of differentiation using transcriptomics data as described in the Campbell reference. One manuscript used the same sentence word-for-word from the introduction “Alterations in Oct4 expression promote differentiation…”. The major implication of this manuscript is the functional role of Oct4 on stem cell function.
