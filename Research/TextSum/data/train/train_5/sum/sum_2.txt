Oct4 is known as a necessary regulator in self renewal, pluripotency and lineage commitment. There are many reports showing its transcriptional role in various signaling pathways, molecular mechanisms and stem cell functions. To better understand the function of Oct4, Campbell et al., 2007 conducted a series of gene expression profiling studies on a variety of murine samples comprising of adult and embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives. Using Oct4 as the marker gene, the main aim of this paper is to identify genes that are direct targets of Oct4, genes that modulate its function and genes that are central to stem cell identity. Through the analysis of microarray datasets by Chip assay followed by correlation analysis, the authors report many genes that are direct targets of Oct4. Genes which are correlated to Oct4, positive and negative, are reported. Gene Ontology statistics (GOstat) analysis was done to categorize genes correlated with Oct4 expression and to validate the target genes. Oct4 showed correlation with genes implicated in chromatin regulation, stem cells cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. This study highlights the important roles of Oct4 in regulation chromatin structure which provide further insight into Oct4`s role in stem cell function, self renewal, pluripotency and differentiation which could be directed to the use of stem cell biology in therapeutic medicine.
