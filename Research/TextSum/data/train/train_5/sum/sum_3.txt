Campbell SummaryIt is known that Oct4 (Pou5f1), As a mediator of the embryonic stem cell state,, plays a central role in self-renewal, pluripotency, and lineage commitment., Expression of Oct4, a POU-homeodomain transcription factor, promotes differentiation and leads to the specification of ectodermal, endodermal, or mesodermal cell lines. To further investigate the function of Oct4, the authors employed gene expression profiling together with a statistical analysis to identify genes highly correlated to Oct4. Gene expression profiling studies were performed on a set of 45 murine samples, collected as part of the Stem Cell Genomics Project, comprised of adult embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives.Genes correlated to Oct4, positive and negative, are reported. GOstat analysis was performed to further to categorize the genes correlated with Oct4 expression. The analysis revealed genes related to transcriptional regulation, intracellular signaling, mRNA splicing, cell cycle, DNA repair and chromatin regulation. The high frequency at which apoptotic genes were negatively correlated to Oct4 and anti-apoptotic genes were positively correlated to Oct4 implies that ‘anti-apoptosis’ is an important theme for maintaining the stem cell state.Through the analysis of microarray datasets by ChIP assay followed by QRT-PCR correlation analysis, the authors report many genes that are direct targets of Oct4. Knowledge of the normal developmental functions of these genes in in regulating chromatin structure in relation to stem cell function, self renewal, pluripotency and cellular differentiation provides insight into how these genes, when mutated, lead to cancer.
