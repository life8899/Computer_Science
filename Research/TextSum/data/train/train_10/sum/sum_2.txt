The manuscript by Wang et al. 2008 describes the expression levels and functional significance of miRNAs in cervical cancer cells and human tissues. Using a cloning and sequence approach, they isolated 174 miRNAs and a microarray assay was used in combination with northern blotting to determine which miRNAs are significantly upregulated or downregulated. The authors determined the expression profile of miRNAs in 8 different cell lines: HPV16+, CaSki, SiHa, HPV18+ HeLa and C4II, HPV68+ ME180 and HPV31+ CIN612 6E and 9E cells. Among the miRNAs, miR-21, miR-24, miR-27a, and miR-205 were most abundant in cervical cancer cells. MiR-126, miR-143, and miR-145 were downregulated and miR-15b, miR-16, miR146a, and miR-155 were upregulated. Based on the functional assay, miR-146a promoted cell proliferation. The results and implication of the manuscript were cited including miR-146a is upregulated in cervical cancer and promotes cell proliferation of cervical cancer cells. Changes in miR-146a and 146b are implicated in the proliferative response in cervical cancer, miR-24 is abundant in cervical cancer, decrease in miRNA expression is found in cancers and may act as suppressors of oncogenes, miR-126 is downregulated in cervical cancer, miR-21 is expressed highly in HeLa and Caski cells, and miR-205 is overexpressed in cervical cancer. One manuscript used miR-21 as an internal control since it is known that it is highly expressed in cervical cancer cells. In conclusion, this manuscript found that miRNA expression levels are aberrantly expressed either upregulated or downregulated and have a functional impact on cervical cancer such as cell proliferation.
