Abstract
We have previously reported that IL-β-induced miR-146a and miR-146b expression negatively regulates IL-8 and RANTES release in human alveolar A549 epithelial cells. To determine the intracellular pathways that regulate this response, we demonstrate IL-1β-induced activation of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB, extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-1/2 and p38 mitogen activated kinase (MAP) kinase pathways. Subsequent pharmacological studies show that IL-1β-induced miR-146a, IL-8 and RANTES production was regulated via NF-κB and JNK-1/2 whilst miR-146b expression was mediated via MEK-1/2 and JNK-1/2. These divergent intracellular pathways likely explain the differential expression and biological action of the miR-146 isoforms.

1. Introduction
miRNA-Mediated RNA interference has been identified as a novel mechanism that regulates gene expression at the translational level [1] and [2]. These short RNA sequences of 20–23 nucleotides are produced by the processing of full length mRNA-like transcripts [3] and [4]. They are believed to either repress mRNA translation or reduce mRNA stability following imperfect binding between the miRNA and the miRNA-recognition elements (MRE) within the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of target genes. Specificity of the miRNA is thought to be primarily mediated by the ‘seed’ region that is localized between residues 2–8 at the 5′ end of the mature miRNA [5], [6] and [7].

The innate immune response provides the initial defense mechanism against infection by external pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. One of the best characterized families of receptors involved in the activation of the innate immune response are the Toll like/interleukin-1 (TL/IL-1) receptors which, in humans, can be subdivided into the Toll-like receptors (TLR) that are composed of 11 members (named TLR-1 to TLR-11) and the interleukin (IL)-1 receptors that have 10 members [8] and [9]. The TLRs recognize conserved molecules within bacteria, fungi and viruses whilst the IL-1 receptors are activated by the pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, IL-18 and IL-33 [9]. Agonism of TL/IL-1 receptors stimulates the production of multiple inflammatory mediators including the chemokines, IL-8 and RANTES. This is thought to be mediated through activation of multiple intracellular signalling pathways that includes nuclear factor (NF)-κB, which under basal conditions is localized within the cytoplasm attached to inhibitor-κBα (IκBα). Degradation of IκBα following the phosphorylation by I-κB kinase-2 (IKK-2) has been shown to result in the nuclear translocation of activated NF-κB and the subsequent transcription of multiple inflammatory mediators [10]. Additional pathways include the mitogen activated kinase cascades that terminate at extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2, c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-1/2 and p38 MAP kinase.

Significantly, recent studies have identified miRNA-mediated RNA interference as a potentially novel mechanism that regulates the immune response [11] and [12]. In particular, rapid increases in miRNA-146 and miRNA-155 expression has been demonstrated in immune cells following activation of members of the TL/IL-1 receptor family [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] and [18]. Of relevance, we have previously reported rapid induction of miR-146a and miR-146b expression in IL-1β-stimulated human alveolar A549 epithelial cells and showed that these miRNAs attenuated the release of the inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and RANTES [19]. Interestingly, decreased expression of miR-146 but not miR-146b has been reported in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis [20], rheumatoid arthritis [21], [22] and [23] and osteoarthritis [24] and [25]. Changes in miR-146a and miR-146b expression and/or binding have also been implicated in the metastatic and proliferative response associated with the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) [26], [27] and [28], cervical cancer [29], ovarian cancer [30], breast cancer [30], [31] and [32], pancreatic cancer [31] and prostate cancer [31] and [33].

However, despite studies demonstrating their differential expression and importance in physiological and pathological responses little is known regarding the intracellular pathways that regulate miR-146a and miR-146b expression. A number of previous reports have suggested that miR-146a transcription is regulated by NF-κB, although no studies have yet examined the role of the MAP kinases [13], [19], [34], [35] and [36]. For this reason, we have used a pharmacological approach to investigate the role of IKK-2, which is an upstream activator of NF-κB and the mitogen activated kinases, MEK-1/2, JNK-1/2 and p38 MAP kinase following IL-1β-induced miR-146a and miR-146b expression in human alveolar A549 epithelial cells.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell studies
Human alveolar epithelial A549 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 2 mM l-glutamine and then plated at 75% confluence in 96-, 24- or 6-well plates, cultured for an additional 1 h in the presence or absence of the indicated concentrations of TPCA-1 (an IKK-2 inhibitor), PD098059 (a MEK-1/2 inhibitor), SP600125 (a JNK-1/2 inhibitor) and SB 203580 (a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor) and then stimulated with 1 ng/ml of IL-1β for the indicated times (see below). All inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem.

2.2. Measurement of IL-8 and RANTES release
A549 cells were plated in 96-well plates and stimulated for 24 h with IL-1β (1 ng/ml). The levels of IL-8 and RANTES in the supernatant were determined by DuoSet ELISA (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

2.3. Measurement of miRNA expression
Total RNA was extracted using the mirVana™ miRNA isolation kit (Ambion Europe) according to the manufacturer’s instructions from A549 cells that had been plated in 24-well plates and stimulated with IL-1β (1 ng/ml) for 24 h. RNA was eluted in 50 μl RNase-free water (Promega UK, Southampton, UK) and stored at −70 °C. RNA content and purity was measured using a BioTek PowerWave XS (SSi Robotics, Tustin, CA, USA) spectrophotometer. miR-146a and miR-146b expression in total RNA extracts were determined by two-step TaqMan® reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction protocol (RT-PCR), normalized to 18S, as previously described [17]. The separate well, 2−(ΔΔCt) method [37] was used to determine relative-quantitative levels of individual miRNAs, and these were expressed as the fold-difference to the relevant controls.

2.4. Western blotting
Proteins were extracted at the indicated times from A549 cells that had been plated in 6-well plates as previously described [38]. Samples were separated upon 10% SDS–PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Amersham Ltd.). Protein (5–10 μg) were detected by Western blotting using a rabbit anti-JNK-1/2 (56G8), rabbit anti-IκBα (44D4), rabbit anti-p38 MAP antibody, rabbit anti-ERK-1/2 antibody (137F5), rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody, rabbit anti-phospho-ERK-1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (D13.14.4E), and a rabbit anti-phospho-JNK-1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185) antibody (81E11) that were purchased from New England Biolabs. All primary antibodies were used a concentration of 1:1000 or 1:2000 and were incubated overnight. Labelling of the first antibody was detected using relevant secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP (Dako Ltd.) and detected using ECL reagents (Amersham Ltd., UK).

2.5. Statistical analysis
Statistical changes in IL-8, RANTES, miR-146a and miR-146b expression were determined using either a two-tailed Student’s t-test or ANOVA with P set to 0.05 using Prism 4 for Windows (version 4.03).

3. Results
3.1. IL-1β-induced activation of the NF-κB and MAP kinase pathways
Prior to examining the action of the inhibitors, we determined whether IKK-2 and the MAP kinase pathways were activated in alveolar A549 epithelial cells following exposure to IL-1β. Phosphorylation of IκBα by activated IKK-2 results in its dissociation from NF-κB and then rapid degradation following ubiquitination. Activation of IKK-2 and NF-κB was indicated through measurement of the total IκBα levels in A549 cells by Western blotting which showed a rapid and transient loss in IκBα expression within 10 min of IL-1β exposure that returned at 60–90 min (Fig. 1). Activation of the MAP kinases pathways was also confirmed by Western blotting using phospho-antibodies that recognize activated ERK-1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), JNK-1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185) and p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) (Fig. 1). From Fig. 1, it can be seen that IL-1β-induced the rapid activation of ERK-1/2, JNK-1/2 and p38 MAP kinase, in which the levels of phosphorylations were increased at 5 min and remained elevated throughout the 120 min period.

3.2. Effect of pharmacological inhibitors upon IL-1β-induced chemokine release and miR-146 expression
We have previously shown that IL-1β-induced both miR-146a and miR-146b expression and the release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and RANTES [19]. To determine the role of these intracellular pathways in regulating these IL-1β-induced responses, we examined the action of the selective pharmacological inhibitors TPCA-1 (IKK-2 inhibitor) [39] and [40], PD098059 (an inhibitor of ERK kinase-1/2 or MEK-1/2, an upstream activator of ERK-1/2) [41] and [42], SP600125 (JNK-1/2 inhibitor) [43] and [44] and SB 203580 (p38 MAP kinase inhibitor) [45] and [46].

As previously reported, IL-1β stimulation of human alveolar A549 epithelial cells induced both miR-146a and miR-146b expression and the release of IL-8 and RANTES at 24 h (Fig. 2). Examination of the ΔCT values (versus 18S) obtained by RT-PCR indicated that basal miR-146a and miR-146b expression was identical at 15.6 ± 0.3 (n = 12) and 15.1 ± 0.2 (n = 12), respectively. Following IL-1β exposure, measurement of the relative change showed a 34.4 ± 5.7-fold increase (n = 12) in miR-146a expression compared with a much smaller 4.8 ± 0.5-fold (n = 12) elevation in miR-146b level. Pre-treatment with the IKK-2 inhibitor (TPCA-1) caused a concentration-dependent reduction in IL-1β-induced IL-8 and RANTES release with IC50’s of 4.4 and 1.2 μM, respectively ( Fig. 2A and B). Under these conditions, we also observed a reduction in miR-146a ( Fig. 3A) but not miR-146b ( Fig. 3B) expression as the concentration of TPCA-1 was increased from 1 to 10 μM. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect upon either IL-8 or RANTES release ( Fig. 2C and D) or miR-146a expression ( Fig. 3C) at concentrations up to 10 μM but significantly reduced the expression of miR-146b between 1 and 10 μM ( Fig. 3D). Inhibition of JNK-1/2 using SP600125 (0.1–10 μM) resulted in a concentration dependent decrease in IL-8 and RANTES release with IC50’s of 0.94 and 0.92 μM, respectively ( Fig. 2E and F) and inhibition of miR-146a at 10 μM (μM) ( Fig. 3E). In addition, SP600125 also attenuated IL-1β-induced miR-146b expression and this was seen at both 1 and 10 μM ( Fig. 3F). Finally, studies using the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB 203580 showed no effect upon either IL-1β-induced IL-8 and RANTES generation ( Fig. 2G and H) or miR-146a and miR-146b expression ( Fig. 3G and H).

4. Discussion
Recent studies have demonstrated the rapid induction in the expression of miR-146a and miR-146b following activation of the innate immune response by plasma membrane associated members of the TLR/IL-1 receptor superfamily [13] and [19]. Functional studies indicate that increased miR-146a and miR-146b expression is involved in the negative regulation of the TLR/IL-1 receptor induced inflammatory response [13], [19] and [34]. However, a number of reports have indicated that miR-146a expression is regulated via NF-κB [13], [19], [34], [35] and [36], even though nothing is known about the mechanisms that regulate miR-146b expression. In addition, it is unclear whether miR-146a and/or miR-146b transcription is also regulated by members of the MAP kinase family, which are also commonly activated via the TLR/IL-1 receptors. To address this question, we employed a pharmacological based approach to investigate the role of the MAP kinases; MEK-1/2, JNK-1/2 and p38 MAP kinase during IL-1β-induced miR-146a and miR-146b expression in the human alveolar A549 epithelial cells. In addition, we have used an IKK-2 inhibitor to examine the role of NF-κB and determined how these pathways influence the expression of the inflammatory chemokines, IL-8 and RANTES.

As previously reported, IL-1β-induced both miR-146a and miR-146b expression and IL-8 and RANTES release from human alveolar A549 epithelial cells [19]. Using Western blotting, we demonstrated that IL-1β exposure induced rapid and transient degradation of IκBα. Previous investigations in human alveolar A549 epithelial cells indicate that IκBα degradation occurs following phosphorylation by activated IKK-2, that leads to the subsequent nuclear translocation of activated NF-κB [47], [48] and [49]. To assess the role of NF-κB during miR-146a and miR-146b transcription, we therefore examined the effect of the IKK-2 selective inhibitor TPCA-1 [39] and [40]. These studies showed that IL-1β-induced miR-146a expression was mediated via the IKK-2–IκBα–NF-κB pathway since this response was attenuated in the presence of the IKK-2 inhibitor. However, the IKK-2 inhibitor had no effect upon IL-1β-stimulated miR-146b expression which implied that miR-146b transcription was not mediated via NF-κB. A role for NF-κB in miR-146a transcription has previously been reported by a number of investigators [13], [19], [34], [35] and [36]. In particular, Taganov et al. [13] identified three consensus binding sites for NF-κB in the upstream promoter region of the primary miR-146a transcript and demonstrated that site-directed mutagenesis attenuated LPS-, TNFα and IL-1β-induced miR-146a expression. Interestingly, this report also identified a potential NF-κB binding site in the promoter region of miR-146b although our studies would suggest that this is not involved in the IL-1β mediated response [13].

At the present time, little is known regarding the role of the MAP kinases pathways in the regulation of miR-146a and miR-146b transcription. Previous studies of miR-155 transcription, another miRNA that is implicated in the immune response, have indicated a role for JNK in polyI:C stimulated murine macrophages [14] and for ERK and JNK (but not p38 MAP kinase) during BCR-induced activation of the Ramos B-cell line [50]. Using phospho-antibodies, we were able to demonstrate that IL-1β stimulated the rapid and transient activation of the MAP kinases, ERK-1/2, JNK-1/2 and p38 MAP kinase. Using selective inhibitors, we proceeded to show that transcription of miR-146a and miR-146b is regulated via different MAP kinase pathways. Thus, in addition to NF-κB, IL-1β-induced miR-146a expression was regulated via a JNK-1/2-dependent mechanism. In contrast, although miR-146b expression occurred independently of NF-κB, we have shown that this process is mediated via a JNK-1/2- and MEK-1/2-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, neither miR-146a nor miR-146b expression was sensitive to the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580. Examination of the pathways that regulate IL-8 and RANTES release indicate that the transcription of these pro-inflammatory chemokines is mediated via a similar mechanism to miR-146a, i.e. via an NF-kB- and JNK-1/2-dependent mechanism.

Overall, these studies demonstrate that IL-1β-induced miR-146a and miR-146b transcription is mediated via divergent intracellular pathways and we speculate that this impacts upon the differential expression and biological action of the miR-146 isoforms in inflammation and the development of cancer.
