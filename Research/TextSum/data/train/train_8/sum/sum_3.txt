Lewis et al 2003 describe an approach that combines experimental and bioinformatic techniques to predict more than 400 mammalian regulatory target genes of miRNAs. They have developed an algorithm, TargetScan, which is based on identifying mRNAs with conserved pairing to the 5′ region of the miRNA and evaluating the number and quality of these complementary sites. The algorithm provides a scoring system to find likely targets using the principle that pairing to the 5′ portion of the miRNA, particularly nucleotides 2–8, appears to be most important for target recognition by vertebrate miRNAs. This 7 nt segment of the miRNA is referred to as the “miRNA seed”. Scoring is also dependent on sophisticated sequence-based methods looking at matching pairs beyond the seed match and thermodynamics-based modeling of the RNA:RNA interactions. Generated shuffled sequences are used as a controls to assess the level of random matching between miRNA seed sequences and mRNA and identify the level of false positives. The number of predicted targets, through base pair matching, compared to random matches, identified by shuffled sequences, is expressed as a signal to noise ratio.Eleven predicted targets, out of 15 tested were supported experimentally using a HeLa cell reporter system. The predicted regulatory targets of mammalian miRNAs were enriched for genes involved in transcriptional regulation but also encompassed an unexpectedly broad range of other functions. The results indicate that each miRNA can regulate multiple target RNAs, and that individual mRNA can be targeted by several miRNAs, providing considerable complexity.
