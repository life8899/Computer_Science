Abstract
A virus-associated RNA (VAI) of adenoviruses is a cytoplasmic non-coding RNA and it plays an important role for viral replication in infected cells. VAI RNA transcripts, produced by RNA polymerase III (pol III), form tightly structured stems, which confer resistance to cellular defense systems. We demonstrate here that small RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides are produced from a terminal stem region but not from an apical stem of VAI RNA. We determined the processing sites of VAI RNA by S1 nuclease mapping and further confirmed that the processed small RNA can act as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or as microRNAs (miRNAs) in transient transfection assays and during viral infection. Our data demonstrate that non-coding RNAs synthesized by pol III can be substrates for Dicer, and diced small RNAs might regulate cellular phenomena as siRNAs and miRNAs.

1. Introduction
The genome of adenovirus type 2 encodes two non-coding RNAs, VAI and VAII [1]. VAI RNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase III (pol III) and accumulated in large amounts late in the course of infection, and it plays an important role for viral replication in infected cells [2] and [3]. VAI RNA acts as a positive regulator for the neutralization of an interferon-related cellular defense mechanism [4] and [5]. During adenoviral infection, the double-stranded RNA-induced protein kinase (PKR) is activated at late stages, probably by the production of long double-stranded RNAs through the symmetrical transcription of the viral genome [6]. Then, the activated PKR phosphorylates the eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2 (eIF2α), leading to the inhibition of whole protein synthesis [4] and [5]. VAI RNA binds to and blocks the activation of PKR, thereby preventing the PKR-mediated inhibition of the protein synthesis [4], [5], [6], [7] and [8]. VAI RNA forms tightly structured stems, which serve as the binding site for PKR proteins. The secondary structure of VAI RNA includes two short imperfectly base-paired stems, referred to as the terminal and apical stems, respectively, and a structurally complex domain, known as the central domain [9] and [10] (Fig. 1A).

Recently, it has been recognized that animal and plant genomes contain an abundance of small regulatory RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides (nts) in length [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and [17]. One class of small RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) has a variety of functions and is involved in the regulation of gene expression [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] and [26]. So far, many studies revealed the key roles of miRNAs in diverse regulatory pathways, including developmental timing control, apoptosis, organ development and cell differentiation. miRNAs generally repress mRNA translation by partially base-paring to the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs.

In addition to miRNAs, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) confer gene-specific suppression in sequence-dependent manner [27] and [28]. siRNAs are derived from long double-stranded RNAs by an RNase III enzyme, identified as Dicer [29], and one strand of the duplex is incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) [30]. The siRNA component acts as a guide sequence, directing the complex to the target mRNA, and then the RISC catalyzes the sequence-specific cleavage of the target mRNA [31], [32] and [33].

At least some plant miRNAs and one mouse miRNA can induce cleavage of mRNAs similar to siRNA-mediated mRNA degradation [14], [22] and [25]. In addition, recent reports suggested that miRNAs can induce the degradation of mRNAs when the targets contain perfectly complementary sequences [34] and [35]. Thus, miRNAs have at least two functions, translational repression and mRNA cleavage, depending on the degree of complementarity of the target mRNAs. Moreover, in a similar manner as generation of siRNAs, miRNAs are produced by the Dicer ribonuclease [11], [12], [13], [29] and [36].

According to the recent reports, miRNAs are initially synthesized as primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II (pol II), and then pri-miRNAs are processed to precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) of approximately 70 nucleotides (nts), each of which contains a short imperfectly base-paired stem and a loop [37], [38], [39], [40], [41] and [42]. The pre-miRNA is processed to yield miRNAs of approximately 22 nts by the Dicer [11], [12], [13], [29] and [36]. Although the sequence and structural requirements for the processing of substrates by Dicer are not fully understood, Dicer can specifically recognize and cleave short stems with both perfect and imperfect base-pairs [29] and [36]. Therefore, we postulated that VAI RNA might be a substrate for Dicer since this RNA includes two short stem regions with imperfect base-pairs within its secondary structure. Indeed, more recent study by Andersson et al. supported this hypothesis [43], during our attempts to identify the targets of the processed VAI-small RNA.

In the present study, we found that an imperfectly base-paired terminal stem of VAI RNA was processed to small RNAs of ∼22 nts in length in mammalian cells. Remarkably, Dicer was involved in the processing of the terminal stem of VAI RNA, and processed small RNAs strongly suppressed the expression of the target gene that contained perfectly or imperfectly complementary sequences. This evidence indicates that the pol III non-coding transcript, VAI RNA, becomes the source of small RNAs, acting as an miRNA and siRNA.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Construction of plasmids
For in vitro transcription of VAI RNA, we constructed plasmid VAI/pMX-puroΔDra as follows. The plasmid pMX-puroΔDra was generated from plasmid pMX-puro [44] by deleting the sequence from positions 1883 to 3160, with removal of a DraI site. The DNA fragment that included the VAI gene, the T7 promoter sequence and NotI sites was amplified by PCR using the pAdVAntage™ vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as template and it was inserted into the NotI site of pMX-puroΔDra to yield the VAI/pMX-puroΔDra. For luciferase assays, a 115-bp sequence containing three target repeats (positions 119–159 in the sequence of VAI) in tandem was inserted in two orientations into the XbaI site of plasmid pGL3 (Promega) to generate the pGL3-VAI-119F and pGL3-VAI-119R plasmids, as reported previously [45]. To construct plasmids pGL3-VAI-1 (F and R), pGL3-VAI-36 (F and R) and pGL3-VAI-61 (F and R), we used sequences that contained three target repeats (positions 1–37, 36–72 and 61–97 in the sequence of VAI, respectively) in tandem, which were inserted as described above. To construct plasmids pGL3-VAI-s135 (F and R), we used sequence that contained the single target (positions 135–158 in the sequence of VAI), as illustrated in Fig. 4A. To construct plasmids pGL3-VAI-m137 (F and R) and pGL3-VAI-dm137, we used sequence that contained four target repeats (positions 137–158 in the sequence of VAI) with mutations, as illustrated in Fig. 4B.

2.2. Culture and transfection of cells
HeLa S3, HEK 293 and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) and a mixture of antibiotics (Life Technologies). Cells were transfected with a cationic transfection reagent, TransIT-LT1 (Pan Vera, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

2.3. Northern blotting analysis
Cells were grown to approximately 80% confluence (1 × 107 cells) and transfected with the pAdVAntage™ vector or the pPUR vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the TransIT-LT1 reagent. Twenty-four hours later, total RNA was extracted and purified with ISOGEN™ reagent (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Fifty micrograms of total RNA per lane were loaded on a 10% (Fig. 1B) or a 12% (Fig. 1C) polyacrylamide denaturing gel or a 2% an agarose gel (Fig. 5B, top). After electrophoresis, bands of RNA were electro-transferred to a Hybond-XL™ membrane (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ). The membrane was probed with 32P-labeled synthetic oligonucleotides that were complementary to the sequence of VAI RNA.

2.4. Assays of cleavage in vitro
The DNA fragment containing the VAI gene and the T7 promoter sequence was amplified by PCR using the pAdVAntage™ vector as template for in vitro transcription. The VAI RNA was transcribed with an AmpliScribe™ T7 transcription kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, WI), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After transcription, the labeled products were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide/8 M urea gel and the band corresponding to VAI RNA was excised and eluted. End-labeled VAI RNAs were incubated with HeLa cell lysates, which were prepared by lysing cells with lysis buffer [10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mM pefabloc SC (Roche)], at 37 °C for 30 and 60 min. The products of reactions were resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. A decade marker (Ambion) was used as the size marker for single-stranded RNA. For establishment of “Dicer-knockdown” HeLa cells, cells were transfected with 2 μg of pPUR, and 100 nM of siRNA targeted against Dicer (sense: 5′-GAA UCA GCC UCG CAA CAA ATT-3′, antisense: 5′-UUU GUU GCG AGG CUG AUU CTT-3′) or against firefly luciferase (sense: 5′-CUU ACG CUG AGU ACU UCG ATT-3′, antisense: 5′-UCG AAG UAC UCA GCG UAA GTT-3′) (as a control) with Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in 10-cm dishes. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml puromycin and, after an additional incubation for 48 h, the expression of Dicer was examined by PCR with specific-primers (sense: 5′-TTA ACC AGC TGT GGG GAG AGG GCT G-3′, antisense: 5′-AGC CAG CGA TGC AAA GAT GGT GTT G-3′) and cDNA as template after reverse transcription in the presence of a poly-dT primer.

2.5. S1 nuclease mapping
For preparation of the probe, the synthetic oligonuleotide 5′-GGA GCG CTC CCC CGT TGT CTG ACG TCG CAC ACC TGG GTT CTT TTT TTT TT-3′ was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan). The labeled product was purified on a 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and the band of product was excised and eluted. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells that had been transfected with pAdVAntage™ or pPUR and allowed to hybridize with the 5′-end-labeled probe, as described by Hahn (http://www.fhcrc.org/labs/hahn/methods/mol_bio_meth/s1_oligo_probe.html). The reaction mixture was incubated with S1 nuclease (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C and resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gel.

2.6. Dicer reactions in vitro
DNA fragments encoding EBER-1 (Gene ID:16326314) or hY1 (Gene ID: 174899) were prepared by hybridizing sense and antisense oligonucleotides. Template DNA, including 200 bp of the sequence for EGFP, was prepared by PCR using the EGFP-N1 plasmid (Clontech) with appropriate upper (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC GAG GAG CTG TTC ACC GG-3′) and lower (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGG TAG CGG CTG AAG CAC TG-3′) primers. RNA was transcribed in vitro in the presence of [α-32P]CTP using the AmpliScribe™ T7 transcription kit. VAI RNA was also transcribed from linearized VAI/pMX-puroΔDra. All transcripts were purified by electrophoresis on a 6% native polyacrylamide gel and were incubated with a recombinant human Dicer (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The products of the reactions were resolved on a 15% native polyacrylamide gel.

2.7. Luciferase assays
HeLa cells were grown to approximately 50% confluence in 24-well plates and cotransfected, using the TransIT-LT1 reagent, with 0.1 μg of a firefly luciferase reporter construct, 0.1 μg of a Renilla luciferase expression vector (pRL-TK; Promega) and 0.8 μg of the VA-expression vector (pAdVAntage™) or pPUR. Forty-two hours later, luciferase activities were analyzed with a Dual Luciferase system (Promega).

2.8. Viral infection
HeLa cells were infected with adenovirus mutant, Ad2/βGal-4, which was kindly provided by Genzyme Corporation (Framingham, MA, USA). Detection of β-galactosidase assay was detected by staining using the β-galactosidase substrate, X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside), as described elsewhere [46].

3. Results
3.1. VAI RNA is the source of small RNAs
We initially performed Northern blotting analysis to examine whether the stem regions of VAI RNA can be processed into small RNAs of approximately 22 nts. We transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid that encoded genes for VAI and VAII (VA-expressing vector) and, 24 h after transfection, we isolated RNA, fractionated it by electrophoresis, transferred the bands of RNA to a membrane and examined their ability to hybridize to specific probes. These probes complementary to 22-nt sequences of the stem regions of VAI yielded strong signals that corresponded to full-length VAI RNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 6 and 10). Moreover, a small RNA became detectable with increasing duration of exposure, when we used a probe, referred to as Probe 3, that was complementary to the 3′ side of the terminal stem of VAI (Fig. 1B, lane 12; indicated by an arrowhead). By contrast, when we used a probe complementary to the 5′ side of the terminal stem or to the 5′ side of the apical stem of VAI, no similar small RNA was detected under these conditions (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 8). Similar processing of VAI RNA occurred in HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). To estimate the approximate length of the small RNA, we repeated Northern blotting with Probe 3 after changing the condition for electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 1C, we detected bands that corresponded to RNAs of approximately 22 nts, as well as bands of other smaller and larger RNAs. Thus, the imperfectly base-paired terminal stem of VAI RNA was cleaved in mammalian cells, with selective generation of several small RNAs from one side of the stem.

To identify the 3′ processed fragments of VAI RNA in cultured cells, we performed S1 nuclease mapping. Twenty-four hours after transfection of HeLa cells with the VA-expressing vector, we isolated the total RNA and incubated it with a 5′-end-labeled DNA probe of 50 nts that included a sequence complementary to the 3′ terminal stem of VAI RNA (positions 117–156) and additional 10 thymidine residues at the 3′-end of the DNA probe. A band of 20 nts in length was identified, in addition to many less intense bands (Fig. 2A, lane 4, VA). Thus, the processed major products were 20–24 nts in length with terminal (U)n tails (n = 0–4). Although several small RNAs of less than 20 nts in length could be generated from the 3′ terminal stem of the VAI RNA, it was very clear that small RNAs of 20–24 nts were generated in cultured cells. The exact cleavage site identified by the S1 nuclease mapping is indicated in Fig. 2A by an arrowhead (C136).

3.2. Dicer processes VAI RNA to small RNAs
Since VAI RNA had been processed to small RNAs of 20–24 nts by cellular factors in cultured cells, we next examined whether Dicer might be involved in the processing of VAI RNA. We incubated 5′- or 3′-end-labeled VAI RNA with extract of HeLa cells, that had been transfected with either siRNA against human Dicer or siRNA against firefly luciferase, and then fractionated the products of reactions on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To confirm the “Dicer-knockdown” in HeLa cells, we analyzed the transfected HeLa cells with a synthetic siRNA against human Dicer. As shown in Fig. 2B, bottom, siRNA against Dicer reduced the level of Dicer mRNA very efficiently. As shown in lanes 5 and 6 of Fig. 2B, VAI RNA was cleaved specifically immediately after U22 when we incubated the 5′-end-labeled VAI RNA with the extract of HeLa cells that had been transfected with siRNA against firefly luciferase. When we used the 3′-end-labeled VAI RNA, the predominant processing sites in VAI RNA were located immediately after A137 (Fig. 2B, lanes 13 and 14) that was one nucleotide shorter than the previously identified C136 site by the S1 mapping. This might reflect a non-natural 3′-end of the transcribed and 3′-end-C-labeled VAI RNA.

Importantly, no cleavage products of respective end-labeled VAI RNAs were detected when labeled VAI RNAs were incubated with the extract of “Dicer-knockdown” HeLa cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 7, 8, 15 and 16). These results indicated that VAI RNA was processed specifically by Dicer, with cleavages in the vicinity of both sides of the terminal stem. Since we were only able to detect small RNAs from the 3′ side of the terminal stem in living cells by Northern blotting (Fig. 1B and C), it seems likely that short RNAs from the 3′ side of the terminal stem region might accumulate selectively in cells after processing.

To further confirm that VAI RNA can be processed by Dicer, we next treated VAI RNA with recombinant Dicer in vitro. We prepared radio labeled VAI RNA and other non-coding RNAs, namely Epstein–Barr virus-encoded RNA (EBER-1) and human Y1 RNA (hY1). Since each of these RNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III in cells and contains short stems within its secondary structure, each is a possible substrate for Dicer. We also prepared a double-stranded RNA of 200 nts, which corresponded to the gene for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (EGFP dsRNA) as a positive control, and then we incubated all the transcripts with recombinant Dicer. As shown in Fig. 2C, VAI RNA was processed to small products even though the efficiency of the cleavages was relatively low compared to that of the cleavage of EGFP dsRNA. By contrast, EBER-1 RNA and hY1 RNA were not processed to small RNAs of 22–25 nts by Dicer. Thus, of three non-coding RNAs, only VAI RNA was a potential substrate for Dicer. Our results confirmed that VAI RNA was specifically processed to small RNAs of approximately 22 nt by Dicer in vitro.

3.3. VAI RNA suppresses gene expression via an siRNA pathway
After dsRNAs and pre-miRNAs have been processed to RNAs of approximately 21–22 nts by Dicer, the processed small RNAs (siRNAs and miRNAs) are incorporated into RISC and they direct the complex to their target mRNAs. To examine whether the small RNAs derived from VAI RNA might be involved in an siRNA pathway, we used plasmid pGL3 to construct the reporter plasmid pGL3-VAI-119F, which included sequences with perfect complementarity to the 3′ terminal stem region (119–159) of VAI RNA inserted into the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the firefly gene for luciferase (Fig. 3A). We also constructed plasmid pGL3-VAI-119R, which contained target sites in the reversed orientation, for use as a control (Fig. 3A). If the small VAI-derived RNAs were to be incorporated into RISC, they would be expected to act as siRNAs against perfectly matched target sites, with resultant reduction of luciferase activity by the pGL3-VAI-119F construct. Each luciferase reporter plasmid and a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) were introduced into HeLa cells with the VA-expression vector or the pPUR vector, and luciferase activities were determined 42 h after transfection. When the activities of both firefly and Renilla luciferase in cells that harbored pPUR were set at 1 for each reporter plasmid, it was clear that the VA-expression vector efficiently enhanced the luciferase activity due to pGL3 ( Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2), in accordance with earlier reports that the introduction of VA RNAs into cells enhances translational activity by blocking the activation of PKR [7] and [47]. Thus, similar enhancement by VA RNAs was observed for Renilla luciferase (compare lanes 7 and 8).

VAI RNA targets reporter genes via an siRNA pathway. (A) Design of reporter constructs derived from plasmid pGL3. The three tandem repeats with perfect complementarity to the 3′ terminal stem region of VAI RNA (positions 119–159) were inserted into the 3′ UTR of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-VAI-119), in the forward (Fwd) and in the reversed orientation (Rev). Similarly, tandem repeats with perfect complementarity to the 5′ terminal stem region (positions 1–37), the 5′ apical stem region (positions 36–72) and the 3′ apical stem region (positions 61–97) were inserted as described above (pGL3-VAI-1, pGL3-VAI-36 and pGL3-VAI-61). (B) Effects of VAI RNA on the expression of reporter genes with target sequences. Each reporter construct illustrated in (A) and the Renilla luciferase expression plasmid were used to cotransfect HeLa cells, together with the VAI-expressing plasmid or the control pPUR plasmid, and luciferase activities were determined. Relative luciferase activities of VAI-expressing cells are indicated by black columns and the luciferase activities of cells transfected with the control plasmid were set at 1 (open columns) for each reporter plasmid. Fwd and Rev indicate plasmids with target sequences in the forward and the reversed orientation, respectively. Values are means with standard deviation of results from three replicate experiments in each case.

To our surprise, the VA-expression vector significantly suppressed the expression of firefly luciferase when cells were cotransfected with this vector and pGL3-VAI-119F (Fig. 3B, compare lane 6 with lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that the small RNA detected in Fig. 1B and C did indeed act as an siRNA against a perfect target derived from the pGL3-VAI-119F construct. By contrast, the activity of firefly luciferase due to pGL3-VAI-119R was enhanced by the VA-expression vector, resembling the result for pGL3 (Fig. 3B, lane 4). The inhibitory effect was specific to firefly luciferase because the control Renilla luciferase activities were not affected by the same treatment (lanes 7–12).

In addition, we confirmed that the VA-expression vector dramatically reduced the level of the expression of firefly luciferase when cells were cotransfected with this vector and pGL3-VAI-s135F, which included a single target with perfect complementarity to the 3′ terminal stem region (135–158) of VAI RNA (Fig. 4A, lane 6). Thus, VAI RNA dramatically inhibited gene expression when the target contained a sequence that was a perfectly complementary to the 3′ terminal stem region of VAI RNA.

(A) The sequence with perfect complementarity to the 3′ terminal stem region of VAI RNA (positions 135–158) was inserted into the 3′ UTR of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-VAI-s135), in the forward (Fwd) and in the reversed orientation (Rev). Luciferase activities were measured as described in Fig. 3B. (B) The four tandem repeats with imperfect complementarity to the 3′ terminal stem region of VAI RNA (positions 137–158) were inserted into the 3′ UTR of the firefly luciferase gene (pGL3-VAI-m137), in the forward (Fwd) and in the reversed orientation (Rev). Similarly, tandem repeats with five mutations were inserted as described above (pGL3-VAI-dm137). Each reporter construct and the Renilla luciferase expression plasmid were used to cotransfect HeLa cells, together with the VAI-expressing plasmid or the control pPUR plasmid, and luciferase activities were determined. Fwd and Rev indicate plasmids with target sequences in the forward and the reversed orientation, respectively. Mut indicates luciferase activities derived from plasmid pGL3-VAI-dm137.

Next, we examined the effects of VAI RNA on a construct that included three target sites with perfect complementarity to nucleotides 1–37 of VAI RNA, namely, the 5′ terminal stem region (pGL3-VAI-1F) (Fig. 3A). In all cases, luciferase activities were enhanced by VAI RNA (Fig. 3B; see lanes 13–24). However, it is important to note that the extent of activation by the VAI RNA of the pGL3-VAI-1F construct (lane 18) was significantly lower than that of the others (Fig. 3B; compare lane 18 with lanes 14 and 16), suggesting the existence of limited amounts of a small RNA derived from the 5′ terminal stem even though our Northern blotting analysis failed to detect such a small RNA (Fig. 1B, lane 4). It should be emphasized, however, that the inhibitory effect of the VAI-expression vector on the activity derived from pGL3-VAI-1F was marginal compared to that against the activity derived from pGL3-VAI-119F (Fig. 3B; compare lanes 6 and 18).

In addition, we examined the effects of VAI RNA on constructs that included target sites with perfect complementarity to nucleotides 36–72 and 61–97 of VAI RNA, namely, the apical stem region (pGL3-VAI-36F and pGL3-VAI-61F, respectively). In both cases, luciferase activities were strongly enhanced by VAI RNA (Fig. 3B, lanes 30 and 42). Therefore, the apical stem of VAI RNA could not be recognized by Dicer and, thus, not be processed to small RNAs, although this stem contains potential base-pairs of more than 20 nts within its secondary structure (Fig. 1A).

All these results are consistent with our conclusion based on Northern blotting analysis. As described above, our Northern revealed that small RNA was generated only from the 3′ side of the terminal stem of VAI RNA and it accumulated predominantly in cells even though both strands within the terminal stem were processed to small RNAs by Dicer in vitro. Therefore, it is likely that the diced 3′ small products were incorporated preferentially into the RISC, with subsequent efficient and sequence-dependent suppression of the expression of the target reporter gene in pGL3-VAI-119F (Fig. 3B; lane 6). These results are consistent with the recent finding by Andersson et al. [43], and we clearly demonstrated that the small-VAI RNAs from the terminal stem, but not the apical stem, and especially the 3′ terminal stem of VAI had the predominant gene-suppressing activity.

3.4. VAI RNA induces translational repression via a miRNA pathway
To examine whether the small RNAs derived from VAI RNA might cause the gene-silencing in the miRNA pathway, we constructed the reporter plasmid pGL3-VAI-m137F that included imperfectly complementary sequences to the 3′ terminal stem region (137–158) of VAI RNA (Fig. 4B), as described above. Because recent reports demonstrated that the first eight nucleotides of the 5′ end of miRNA could correlate with the efficient translational repression [48] and [49], mismatches were introduced at nucleotides 9–11 positions from the 3′ end of the target sequences (Fig. 4B). We also constructed two other plasmids pGL3-VAI-m137R and pGL3-VAI-dm137, for use as controls (Fig. 4B). The pGL3-VAI-m137R and pGL3-VAI-dm137 contained target sites in the reversed orientation and target sites with two more mismatches at nucleotides 4–5 positions from the 3′ end of the target sequences, respectively. We expected that mismatches at near the 5′ end of miRNA could impair the ability of VAI-derived small RNA to repress the expression of the target gene.

When cells were cotransfected with the VA-expression vector and pGL3-VAI-m137F, the VA-expression vector significantly suppressed the expression of firefly luciferase whereas the vector enhanced the activity of luciferase due to pGL3-VAI-m137R (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 8). In addition, as expected, two more mismatches at the target region completely abrogated the ability of VAI-derived small RNA (Fig. 4B, lane 4). Thus, the small RNA derived from the 3′ terminal stem of VAI can induce translational repression via the miRNA pathway, as well as gene-silencing via an siRNA pathway.

3.5. Attempts to identify the targets of VAI-small RNA
Since the small RNAs derived from VAI RNA caused the gene-silencing of the reporter plasmid pGL3-VAI-m137F that included imperfectly complementary sequences to the 3′ terminal stem region (137–158) of VAI RNA, the VAI-small RNAs might regulate cellular genes as miRNAs. We thus used a computational method in an attempt to identify potential targets for the VAI-derived small RNAs. Although we failed to identify any cellular targets with perfect complementarity to VAI RNA, we did identify several potential targets, including the gene for Dicer (Supplemental Table 1). In addition to Dicer, we predicted several potential targets, including an apoptosis-related gene (NAPOR), and genes for kinases (PAK2 and PIP5K1C), which contain imperfect complementary sequences within their 3′ UTR (Supplemental Table 1). To confirm the potential target sites of candidate mRNAs, we made several reporter constructs consisting of the gene for luciferase fused with the predicted potential target sequence(s) (Supplemental Table 1), the reporter construct corresponding to the one shown in Fig. 4B. The reporter constructs included PKR-activating protein (PACT). Since PACT is an important mediator of cellular defense systems, VAI-small RNAs might help adenoviruses to circumvent cellular defense systems, together with the parental VAI RNA, by blocking the activation of PKR, as schematically illustrated in Supplemental Fig. 1.

Each luciferase reporter plasmid and a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase (pRL-TK) were introduced into HeLa cells with the VA-expression vector or the pPUR vector, and luciferase activities were determined 42 h after transfection. In almost all cases, VAI RNA could not suppress the reporter activity. However, we observed reduction of reporter activity when we cotransfected cells with the VA-expression vector and a reporter construct that included four tandem repeats with the predicted short target sequence, 5′-GAG AAG UGC GCC AAU GUU GUC U-3′, of Dicer ( Supplemental Fig. 2A). Thus, we attached a partial UTR sequence (∼1.3 kb), which contained the predicted target sequence, of Dicer to the reporter gene and measured the luciferase activity. However, VA-expression vector could not reduce the reporter activity of the construct with the partial UTR ( Supplemental Fig. 2B). More detailed analyses are required to identify the real target of VAI-derived miRNA.

3.6. Gene suppression by VAI RNA during adenoviral infection
To further ask whether VAI RNA might inhibit gene-expression via siRNA and miRNA pathways during adenoviral infection, we attempted to use adenovirus mutant with replacement of the early region 1 coding genes, E1A and E1B, by the gene for β-galactosidase [50] and [51]. Since E1A and E1B proteins are essential for the efficient viral replication, this adenovirus mutant is replication incompetent. However, this virus can efficiently infect a broad range of cell lines.

To initially examine the efficiency of the viral infection, we infected HeLa cells with various titers of the adenovirus mutant, and assayed for β-galactosidase 42 h after infection. Although 5.5 × 108 units/ml of the virus showed the highest level of infection, the virus in this condition impaired the rate of cell growth. Therefore, for further studies, we decided to use 2 × 107 units/ml of the virus, which conferred approximately 70% efficiency of infection (Fig. 5A).

Relative luciferase activities of infected cells are indicated by black columns and the luciferase activities of cells without viral infection were set at 100% (open columns) for each reporter plasmid.

We next investigated the expression of VAI RNA during viral infection using infected HeLa cells. Northern blotting analysis revealed that VAI RNA was detectable 8 h after infection, and levels of expression were gradually increased until 32 h after infection even if the expression level of VAI was much lower than that due to VAI-expression vector (Fig. 5B, top). Moreover, approximately 22 nts of small RNAs became detectable 24 h after infection, when we used the probe that was complementary to the 3′ side of the terminal stem of VAI, as indicated in Fig. 1A (Fig. 5B, bottom, indicated by an arrowhead).

To examine the effect of viral infection on the plasmid pGL3-VAI-s135F that included a single target site with perfect complementarity to 3′ side of the terminal stem of VAI, as illustrated in Fig. 4A, HeLa cells were cotransfected with pGL3-VAI-s135F and pRL-TK, and infected the cells with the virus 6 h after transfection, and luciferase activities were determined further 42 h after infection. When the relative luciferase activities in cells with no viral infection were set at 100% for the reporter plasmid, it was clear that the virus efficiently inhibited the luciferase activity due to pGL3-VAI-s135F (Fig. 5C, lane 6). In contrast, the virus slightly enhanced the activity of firefly luciferase due to both pGL3 and pGL3-VAI-s135R, which included the target in the reversed orientation (Fig. 5C, lanes 2 and 4). Based on the reporter assay by using VAI-expressing vector, VAI RNA can strongly suppress gene-expression when a target contains perfectly matched sequence, whereas VAI can increase the level of expression of reporter genes with unrelated targets.

We next examined whether viral infection could have some effects on the construct pGL3-VAI-m137F, which included imperfectly matched targets, as illustrated in Fig. 4B. As shown in Fig. 5C, bottom, the luciferase activity due to pGL3-VAI-m137F was dramatically suppressed during viral infection (compare lane 14 with lanes 8, 10, 12). Importantly, the virus enhanced the luciferase activity due to pGL3-VAI-dm137, which included target sites with additional mismatches at the 5′ region of VAI-derived small RNA. Thus, these results apparently indicate that VAI RNA can be processed to small RNAs during viral infection, and resultant products can act as not only siRNA but also miRNA against both perfectly and imperfectly matched targets.

4. Discussion
Adenoviruses have evolved several strategies that allow them to counteract cellular defense systems. For example, the virus-encoded pol-III transcripts VAI and VAII RNAs play an important role in efficient viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated that small RNAs derived from VAI RNA can suppress gene expression in a sequence-dependent manner, in accordance with the recent findings by Andersson et al. [43]. Our analysis revealed that the 3′ terminal stem region of VAI RNA was indeed processed to small RNAs (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2A). Dicer was involved in the processing of VAI RNA (Fig. 2B and C), and subsequently small RNAs derived from the 3′ stem of VAI were preferentially incorporated into RISC to inhibit the expression of genes that included sequences complementary to VAI RNA (Fig. 3). Further analysis demonstrated that VAI-derived small RNA can act as miRNA because the VAI-small RNA could suppress gene-expression even if the targets contained mismatches at the center of the target region (Fig. 4B, lane 8). However, mismatches near the 5′ end of the small RNA completely abrogated translational suppression (Fig. 4B, lane 4), as reported by other groups [48] and [49]. We demonstrated that the pol-III transcript, VAI RNA, can be a substrate for Dicer, and the resultant small RNAs derived from the 3′ terminal stem of VAI RNA can act as siRNA and miRNA. Our results suggested that other pol III-transcribed non-coding RNAs might be substrates for Dicer, and diced products might regulate cellular phenomena although two non-coding RNAs, EBER-1 and hY1, could not produce ∼22 nts small RNAs by the Dicer in vitro.

To date, numerous miRNAs have been identified, and pol II is thought to be the main polymerase for miRNA transcription [39] and [40], except in the case of recently identified mouse gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68)-derived miRNAs that are produced from pol III tRNA promoter [52]. Our data suggested that some potential miRNAs were derived from pol III transcript. It is possible that some of pol III non-coding RNAs with stable stem structures might be precursors for producing siRNAs and miRNAs. In fact, we found that small RNAs are generated in cultured cells from the 3′ terminal stem of VAII RNA and that they promote sequence-dependent gene-silencing during viral infection (Supplemental Fig. 3), as also reported by Andersson et al. [43]. Thus, small RNAs derived from pol III transcripts might act similarly to siRNA and miRNA in vivo. However, it should be noted that VAI and VAII RNA have to use the Exportin 5-mediated nuclear export pathway, which recognizes small RNAs containing a terminal stem and a short 3′ overhang, i.e., essentially perfect substrate for Dicer cleavage [54] and [55], so that the inefficient production of a low level of VAI-small RNAs may be a function of the similarity of the sequence requirements of Exportin 5 and Dicer and, hence, physiological relevance needs to be further examined.

Tuschl and coworkers identified several genes for miRNAs in the genome of Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) and they used a computational method to predict targets for EBV miRNAs [53]. Recently, other viral miRNAs have been identified from Kaposi sarcoma-associated virus, human cytomegalovirus, simian virus 40 and others [52], [56] and [57]. Computational predictions allowed them to identify several host-cell and viral encoding targets for viral miRNAs. Viral miRNAs are probably involved in the regulation of many cellular phenomena associated with viral replication. Importantly, our results demonstrated that sequence-specific gene suppression by VAI RNA occurred during adenoviral infection (Fig. 5C). This result allows the hypothesis that VAI-small RNAs might regulate cellular phenomena similarly to miRNA and siRNA, although our attempts to identify the exact targets were not successful (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). Unfortunately, all our reporter constructs for the potential targets, including Dicer, did not show significant suppression by the VAI-small RNAs when each target gene was examined individually. It should be mentioned, however, that we cannot exclude the possibility that the VAI-small RNAs might simultaneously target multiple genes, including e.g. Dicer, and only the synergetic effects might regulate cellular phenomena. More detailed analyses are required to identify the real target of VAI-derived miRNA.

Adenovirus VAI RNA can help adenoviruses to circumvent cellular defense systems by blocking the activation of PKR. Recently, Lu and Cullen have reported that VAI RNA could also inhibit RNAi and the biogenesis of both miRNA and siRNA through the inhibition of nuclear export of pre-miRNA and shRNA, and inhibition of the function of Dicer by binding to Dicer [55]. They suggested that VAI RNA might counteract cellular defense systems against adenovirus by attenuating any RNAi responses to viral infection, as seen in some plant viruses [58]. Moreover, Akusjärvi and coworkers have also reported that adenovirus VAI and VAII RNAs (VA RNAs) have capacity to suppress RNAi by blocking Dicer and RISC functions [43]. They provided evidence that extracts prepared from cells at late stages of adenoviral infection suppressed Dicer activity in vitro, and that VA RNAs were processed into small RNAs during lytic infection. Moreover, in vitro diced-VA RNAs suppressed the expression of luciferase from reporter plasmids that contain partial sequences of VA RNAs. They suggested that the terminal stem of VA RNAs could be incorporated into RISC.

Our present data are consistent with their observation. However, we further determined the possible processing sites of VAI RNA and confirmed that the processed small RNA can act as miRNAs or as siRNAs in transient transfection assays and during viral infection. Indeed, the VAI RNA dramatically reduced the level of the expression of reporter luciferase from pGL3-VAI-s135F, which included a short single target with perfect complementarity to the 3′ terminal stem region (135–158) of VAI RNA (Fig. 4A). In addition, VAI-derived small RNA can suppress gene-expression even if the target contains mismatches at the center of the target region (Fig. 4B). A quantitative analysis estimated that the processing efficiency of VAI was approximately 0.7% during wild-type adenoviral infection (calculated from the results shown in Supplemental Fig. 4). Since the high copies of VAI RNA are expressed at late times of an adenovirus infection (up to 108 copies/cell), the processed small RNA can act to repress the level of the target expression as miRNAs because more than 105 copies of small RNAs can be produced in the cell.

Multiple functions of VAI RNA probably are essential for efficient replication during viral life cycle. We demonstrate that small RNAs derived from VAI RNA can indeed suppress gene expression in a sequence-dependent manner. Therefore, it seems possible that such small RNAs are able to regulate the phenomena that are involved in cellular defense systems and help adenoviruses to escape the action of the defense systems.
