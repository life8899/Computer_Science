	Sherr and McCormick, 2002 review the role of the RB and p53 pathways in cancer biology. Both RB and p53 are commonly mutated in tumors and upstream or downstream members of these pathways are frequently mutated in various cancers as well.  The article reviews the normal functions of the interconnecting signaling pathways regulated by RB and p53 during cell cycle progression. RB  regulates cell cycle by controlling the transcription of genes needed for DNA replication and entry into S-phase. p53 on the other hand is involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following DNA damage, hypoxia, or oncogene activation. These important roles in regulating cell cycle and proliferation easily explain the serious cellular problems observed when RB and p53 pathways are mutated or disrupted. The article then discusses the effects of mutating these pathways in humans and in mouse models. A series of genetic mutations of the RB and p53 pathways can lead to the progressive transformation of cells into malignant invasive cancers. These resulting phenotypes of RB and p53 pathway mutants offer insight into their normal biological functions as well as reveal the complex nature of tumor development in their absence. The article discusses the seemingly universal mutation of RB and/or p53 in cancers and attempts to explain this phenomenon based on their essential roles. Additionally, the findings discussed here provide guidance for potential therapeutic opportunities for the rational design of new cancer drugs and treatment strategies that target RB and p53 signaling at various points in the pathways.
