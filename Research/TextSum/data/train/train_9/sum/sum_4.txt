The manuscript by Sherr and McCormick 2002 describes the connection between retinoblastoma (RB) and p53 transcriptional factor proteins. Most citing manuscripts referred to the connection of the RB pathway in cancers and the connection between RB and p53. One manuscript cited the importance of RB in cancers by stating that RB and INK4a are mutually exclusive in regulating the G1 to S phase transition. The same citing manuscript referred to the RB pathway lesions in human tumors that act in a mutually exclusive manner. Another citing manuscript referred to the p16 kinase inhibitor, which functions as a regulator of cell cycle progression through G1/s phase by binding cdk4 and 6, and preventing phosphorylation of RB. One manuscript cited that E2F is upstream of p53 and is a critical component of the tumor suppressor pathway, which is not a major finding of the reference article. Another article cited that in most cancers p53 is mutated or there is a loss in p14ART in tumors. This article also stated that there is a loss in p53 downstream effectors such as BAX, which was not described in the referring article. Another article referred to the loss of RB and p53 leads to upregulation of ribosome biogenesis, which was not described in the referring article. One article stated that the G1 phase is where a cell differentiates into a particular cell type, which was not described in the referring article. The major finding of this article was that RB is reduced in many cancers.
