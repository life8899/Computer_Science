Chapter 10, Pages 730-731, Programming Exercise #4

Write a program that converts a number entered in Roman Numerals to a positive integer. Your program must consists of a class romanType. A romanType object must do the following: store the number as a Roman numeral, converts and store the number as a positive integer; print the number as a Roman numeral or as a positive integer.

The values of Roman Numerals is as follows:
	M	1000
	D	500
	C	100
	L	50
	X	10
	V	5
	I	1

Test the program with the following numerals MCXIV, CCCLIX, MDCLXVI

This is your first trip into Classes.  Will be looking for:

* Documentation
* Correctness of approach, ie, where your functions are (main vs. class), where your inputs/outputs are (main vs. class)

As a hint... input and output of data should be in main.  Let your class do the work through parameter passing and functions that return values.
