Exercise 12

The population of town A is less than the population of town B. However, the population of town A is growing faster than the population of town B. Write a program that prompts the user for the population and growth rate of each town; outputs after how many years the population of town A will be greater than or equal to town B and the populations.

* Documentation
* Inputs/Outputs labeled
* Loop to calculate the # of years
* Be sure to include an if statement to ensure your values are valid before starting your loop

Exercise 13

Suppose that the first number of a sequence is an integer x.

	a0 = x;
	an is even: an+1 = an / 2
	an is odd:	an+1 = 3 * an + 1

There also exists an integer k such that ak = 1. Write a program that prompts the user for the value of x; outputs the integer k such that ak = 1 and the numbers a0, a1, ..., ak; and test with the following values of x: 75, 111, 678, 732, 873, 2048, 65535.

* Documentation
* Inputs/Outputs labeled
* Enters x before the loop begins
* Then has a while loop to calculate the new value of x each iteration
* Should use an if/else to determine if x is even or odd (think modulus)
* Within each iteration of the loop, output x
* After the loop, output k
