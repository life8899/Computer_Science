\emph{Qualitative Assessment of Initial Relational Model} &
The relational model is qualitatively evaluated along the following dimensions: clear semantics, redundant information and update anomalies, NULL values, and generation of spurious tuples. The evaluation is clearly and concisely documented using appropriate technical vocabulary. &
The relational model is qualitatively evaluated using only a subset of the following dimensions: clear semantics, redundant information and update anomalies, NULL values, and generation of spurious tuples. The evaluation is clearly and concisely documented using appropriate technical vocabulary. &
The relational model is qualitatively evaluated using only a subset of the following dimensions: clear semantics, redundant information and update anomalies, NULL values, and generation of spurious tuples. The evaluation is not clearly and concisely documented using appropriate technical vocabulary. &
There is no evidence of systematic evaluation and its precise documentation. \\ \midrule

\emph{Identification of Functional Dependencies (FDs)} &
Clearly documented evidence is provided to assure that the identified FDs accurately reflect the true characteristics of the real-world data, and are not based on sample data. The FDs are documented using the standard notation. &

The Database Design (DBD) tool is not used to decompose relations so that the resulting relations are all in 3NF or BCNF. It appears that the relations are decomposed using intuition or some other undocumented means. The final schema documentation includes primary and foreign keys for some relations. \\ \midrule

\emph{Physical Database Design} & 
All database queries and transactions including their peak frequencies and volumes are correctly identified and documented. Storage structures and access paths for each relation are identified and specified accurately. &
Over 75\% of database queries and transactions including their peak frequencies and volumes are correctly identified and documented. Storage structures and access paths for most relations are identified and specified accurately. &
Over 50\% of database queries and transactions including their peak frequencies and volumes are correctly identified and documented. Storage structures and access paths for some relations are identified and specified. &
For only about 25\% of database queries and transactions including their peak frequencies and volumes are  identified and documented. Storage structures and access paths for some relations are identified and specified. \\ \bottomrule

\section{Self-assessment}

Use the following table and the rubric of section~\ref{sec:Rubric} to score your solution. Circle the appropriate number in each row. For example, to circle 20, use the \LaTeX{} markup code \verb+\circled{20}+, which produces \circled{20}.
